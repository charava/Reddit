IDEA company,6," Why isn't there a company that invests in ideas? Like raw ideas?

Currently  the first line of investment is held by venture capitals or crowdfundings. But at the very very least they need a grown idea with a  good business plan and nobody is interested in ideas that come from  people who don't have the luxury or the time to get it to those steps.

Imagine  a truck driver. He is driving and he thinks to himself why something  that could help him with a specific situation and this is common amongst  truck drivers? Or a local man in a poor country that sees the potential  that is lying there but no one sees the opportunity and eventually poor  man forgets it and leaves it behind (has happened to me).

Some  people don't have the luxury of resources in rich countries but they do  have great ideas that can make money! It's baffling to me that no  company has been created for this purpose. If I had the money I would've  built it.

On the other hand we have these sham companies that take your money to promote your idea but nothing comes out of it.

I  think to myself if someone had money he would take ideas for free, examine them and if they were good and executable then they give the  person with the idea a portion of the shares of the joint company that  is made to promote and execute that idea.

You'd  think most of it will be useless and people will not generate enough  good material to make profit but see how successful crowdbased platforms  like twitter, facebook, reddit have become. Or how multiplayer gaming  is a good proof with regular people in the action ideas are way better  originated and it will become such a successful business.",rbvnwf

Music responding to your efficiency,1,"i'm new to this subreddit but i really thought that i have a good idea

it's realatively simple.

this would be a pc app running in the background and looking how many wpm (words per minute) you were typing and the rythm and progression would adjust so that the faster you typed the faster the beat and rythm would be and when you hit a goal that you could set yourself, the good part comes on

An Idea for a single shot slasher film,0,"An elderly lady pulling her suitcase by its handle approaches the sergeant at the front desk of a police station. She waits until he notices her and asks how he can help her.
She replies ""I have been having a problem with the neighbourhood kids."" She drops her beheaded dead cat on the counter. ""They killed my cat and forced me out of my house."" 

The film then plays in reverse following her backwards down the street past the crowds of people going about their lives back through alley ways where she is avoided even by violent criminals and eventually we get to her house now on fire. She enters the house which exploded in flames in reverse. We follow her to a kitchen where she puts food wrapped in newspaper into the suitcase from the countertop. We follow her out of the kitchen where she closet where she retrieved her suitcase. We follow her back to the kitchen where she chops up fresh meat into cuts and wraps them up in newspaper.
She carries meat from the kitchen backward down into a cellar where she dismembers bodies of teenagers fighting them to the death with a meat cleaver who she finds have broken in through a cellar window and are searching for things to take.",rauju0
Low-cost cheap electronic trackers which Amazon includes in their packages to areas where porch pirates are known to be active,39,"As the title says - Amazon should include low-cost cheap electronic trackers (which only have enough battery life for maybe a week) into packages going to high-risk areas.

They reflect sunlight up into another reflector about a foot across that refocuses the light down through a hole in the middle of the umbrella that’s about a foot across. So a circle of sunlight something like a yard or more in diameter is concentrated to a circle a foot in diameter. It still probably wouldn’t clear snow very fast so it’d best be on wheels that can be moved along and adjusted. In the end though you’d only need salt on high traffic areas as the sunlight would clear and dry the area it’s used on.",ra8otw

Trashcan with a censor that has the ability to sense the type of object it is and dump it into one of its two baskets (recyclable/not) accordingly,0,People often are unsure whether or not the item they are throwing out is recyclable. What ends up happening is that items that should be recycled are put in the typical bin and that items that should be put in the typical bin are recycled. Places then have to go through the piles of trash to correctly organize them. What we could do instead is attach a censor using [existing technology](https://medium.com/deepquestai/train-object-detection-ai-with-6-lines-of-code-6d087063f6ff) to a bin. It will identify whether the object should be recycled or not and dump it into one of its two baskets accordingly.,r9y2rk

Let's make English muffins have the same square area as toast,6,"Let's say the average square area of English muffins is:

Diameter = 3"", Radius = 1.5""

A =  3.14 \* R^(2)

A = 3.14 \* 1.5^(2) = 7 square inches

\-----------------------------------------------

Let's say the average square area of toast is:

5"" X 5"" = 25 square inches  
 \-----------------------------------------------

That means toast is 25 / 7 = 3.5 times larger!  That's crazy!

\-----------------------------------------------

So, to make English muffins 25 square inches to match toast:

25 = 3.14 \* R^(2)

R = 2.82"" or D = 5.6""

We need English muffins to be baked at a 5.6"" diameter.",rfm50x
