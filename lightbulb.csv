"a small oval valve you stick in a babys butt, that blocks poop from coming out for 1 minute while playing a loud alarm, so you have a minute to stop the baby from pooping on the floor, and if you dont come then it lets the poop out",0,,r01jkr
New traffic laws for highways,1,"I proposed this to the wife after someone flew by us doing 100+mph while my kids were sleeping in the back.

All highways have 2 or 3 lanes today. We institute a new speed limit rule. Slow lane = today's roads current limit except there is a min speed limit included as well. So 65 becomes [50 - 65].  The next lane bumps up [65 - 75]. Third lane goes [75 - 85]. The numbers aren't critical as long as there is a logical progression upward. 
Here's the part that really matters though:
Speeding fines are jacked WAAAAAY up. I'm talking $2,000 fines on the spot, no warnings. $250 for going too slow. Or even better, you lose your license for 30 days if you get caught even 1x, and then it's a massive fine if you are caught again during the 30 day suspension. Idk, but it needs to be so incredibly harsh that it changes the risk/reward value for those who speed at 100mph. On top of this, we install radar along the highways to completely replace police having to sit and use radar guns. If radar catches you, boom. Ticket is mailed to your home. Seeing a cop on the side can cause people to simply slow down then speed back up after. Or Google maps warns them in advance. But speed traps don't actually prevent speeding, they just delay it slightly. Having inconspicuous solar radar units would be impossible to sneak by, so the lunatics would be forced to go 85/90mph max in a single lane that is always moving quickly. 
My theory is that this would actually reduce accidents because the speeders are bad, but not often the cause of the accidents per se. They crash when met with slower traffic/bad drivers. This new system tries to keep those people away from each other. And they can't weave in and out on of traffic because if you're doing 90 in the fast lane you'll be fine, but if you skip into the middle or slow lane, then you are WAAAAAY over that speed limit and get smashed with a huge penalty.

My wife hates the idea and thinks it is too. ""big brother"". Which I don't disagree with...But have also seen the estimated counts for car accidents and it makes me sick that my kids might be one of those statistics one day when they did nothing wrong and followed the existing rules. So I'm ok with a limited big brother. Plus this frees up cops to...ya know...do actual police work. Who suffers in this new system? Adrenaline junkies. Who wins? The other 99% of the cars in the road, police, non drivers who pay taxes to staff police forces. I guess mechanics would be pissed about it...sorry guys.",r01hrm
