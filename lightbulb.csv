"In every form of media there is one outstanding ""life-changing"" work.",1,"I don't know if this will be taken down or not, but I don't know where else to post it. Essentially, I got this idea after disappearing down several Internet rabbit holes that every piece of media, whether it be a book, a movie, or a painting, has one or multiple instances that have the power to change one's life. I think a good example would be The Caretaker's Everywhere at the End of Time. This album is a terrifying portrayal of the decay of a brain affected with dementia, and everyone who has listened to it says that they viewed dementia, as well as their life in general, differently afterwards. Another good example would be the novel House of Leaves. While at first it seems like a boring book about a non-existent movie, it soon starts to take a dark turn as the book's contents affect the sanity of both the author and the reader. Once again, many people who have read this said it changed their perspective of the world. If anyone knows of any other examples of ""life-changing"" media, let me know. I really hope that there are more examples like this out there; I'm afraid that my theory will break down with paintings and poems and stuff like that.

A P2P torrent like personal data cloud library,1,"Download an app on your phone, personal computers, and/or home servers (maybe with settings to limit the amount of storage space used for certain devices), sign in with your own personal password, and join a pool with friends or family who have the same app. Each individual user gets an encrypted folder where all their meta data is stored and only accessable by them and is distributed across  all the devices in the pool.

This way you get the benefits of meta data while keeping that info private from advertisers. The app itself could even suggest where/how to recruit new pool members to improve redundancy. ie there's a cable provider that goes down affecting an entire region where a portion of your pool lives. However, the app had suggested you add/and you did add users from another region with a different ISP so you still have access to your meta data through your mobile providers network and these out of region pool members.",r1hs0y
"AI ""Radio host""",1,"So the other day I was listening to some music on my spotify and towards the end of the track it did that thing where it overlaps the current song with the next one and essentially makes it a smooth transition for you where you don't have to pause and wonder what emotion you're going to feel next but kinda find yourself falling into it as the one song ends and the next begins.

When this happened I had this train of thought where I wondered how we aren't living in a tine where we have an AI, (I don't know much about this stuff but just bare with me) like a Siri or whatever who essentially talks to you, tells you the weather often enough, the traffic for your specific route, your coming soon list on netflix, I dunno there so much stuff to talk about when your target market is the only person listening

You introduce a bill. People can say yes or no at anytime during the year.

If enough people say yes to something, it passes. You do not even need the 'no' vote system really. The result should be treated the same that you always need a majority of congress in it's entirety not just of those who voted. If there is a majority then those who don't vote or voted no are the same. You know this is what people want from the people who say present occassionally in protest of strong arming everything in.

New traffic laws for highways,0,"I proposed this to the wife after someone flew by us doing 100+mph while my kids were sleeping in the back.

All highways have 2 or 3 lanes today. We institute a new speed limit rule. Slow lane = today's roads current limit except there is a min speed limit included as well. So 65 becomes [50 - 65].  The next lane bumps up [65 - 75]. Third lane goes [75 - 85]. The numbers aren't critical as long as there is a logical progression upward. 
Here's the part that really matters though:
Speeding fines are jacked WAAAAAY up. I'm talking $2,000 fines on the spot, no warnings. $250 for going too slow. Or even better, you lose your license for 30 days if you get caught even 1x, and then it's a massive fine if you are caught again during the 30 day suspension. Idk, but it needs to be so incredibly harsh that it changes the risk/reward value for those who speed at 100mph. On top of this, we install radar along the highways to completely replace police having to sit and use radar guns. If radar catches you, boom. Ticket is mailed to your home. Seeing a cop on the side can cause people to simply slow down then speed back up after. Or Google maps warns them in advance. But speed traps don't actually prevent speeding, they just delay it slightly. Having inconspicuous solar radar units would be impossible to sneak by, so the lunatics would be forced to go 85/90mph max in a single lane that is always moving quickly. 
My theory is that this would actually reduce accidents because the speeders are bad, but not often the cause of the accidents per se. They crash when met with slower traffic/bad drivers. This new system tries to keep those people away from each other. And they can't weave in and out on of traffic because if you're doing 90 in the fast lane you'll be fine, but if you skip into the middle or slow lane, then you are WAAAAAY over that speed limit and get smashed with a huge penalty.

My wife hates the idea and thinks it is too. ""big brother"". Which I don't disagree with...But have also seen the estimated counts for car accidents and it makes me sick that my kids might be one of those statistics one day when they did nothing wrong and followed the existing rules. So I'm ok with a limited big brother. Plus this frees up cops to...ya know...do actual police work. Who suffers in this new system? Adrenaline junkies. Who wins? The other 99% of the cars in the road, police, non drivers who pay taxes to staff police forces. I guess mechanics would be pissed about it...sorry guys.",r01hrm

"A blockchain system to reveal corrupted politicians, high ranking officers etc...",0,"I been thinking for a while how we can solve some of the corruption happening across the world. There are people who experience Injustice all the time, extortion from the poor. These people are  afraid to come out and share their experience and what the corrupted person did.

I think blockchain is the way to go about exposing these criminals.

Users are completely anonymous.

1 - They can submit evidence they have collected ( including the corrupted individuals pictures ) and upload it to the system anonymously.

2 - The uploaded data is sent to the verification area, where others users review the evidence and footage collected and judge it, once the post has substantial backing from the users it is placed into the main area where everyone can see and it will there forever. ( While the verification system is not perfect, it can be improved overtime. )

3 - The main area can be filtered out to search for individuals from specific part of the country / town. This can help users avoid these individuals.

Of course, this is not a perfect system and I have not thought about it at a deeper level. My technical skills are not enough to build this complex system either. But it is for sure a way we can bring forth such individuals to the public eye.",r3228v

Would a website specifically for freelance developers (to find assignments/jobs) be ideal for you?,3,"Foreword: This isn't about self-promotion. I don't know if this one is a survey. But the goal is to support freelance developers. If this post gets deleted, then it's fine by me.

Hello freelance developers (or anyone who wants to be a freelancer in the future)

I am planning to make a simple non-profit website where potential clients like a baker can post an assignment/job. They need to enter the title as summary what they want, description for more details and their email address so developers can contact them. An assignment is basically a request for freelance developers to make an app for them. It can be a website, mobile app, etc. everything related to IT development.

These assignments are visible for us freelance developers as a list (you can also filter assigments) to see and choose which one we want to work on. You can see the email address of the person who posted this assignment so you can initiate a call. You can also filter assignments based on whether if it's about bugfixes that needs to be fixed, or to extend their existing app or start an app completely from scratch, or mixed and more. And you can search assignments by keywords you're typing.

Click on one of the assignments will navigate you to the detail page. On that page, a more detailed description and contact info like email address of the client are visible. You can contact the client by email (or by phone, the project can and mostly will, evolve). And after that moment, it's all between you two: the client e.g. the baker and a developer (you). There are no middleman, no fees. You and the client discuss how the payment should be processed: by bank transfer, cash, or trade, etc. Entirely up to you. So basically, this project is more community driven. The development and maintenance support can be handled by ads and/or donation.

So this app is really simple: it provides you a (filtered) list of all the assignments of every potential client around the world, you can see and decide for yourself which one to pick, call the client and off you go. No middleman, no fees, it's now all on you and the client.

Yes there are other related services like Fiverr, Upwork, etc. but they charge you a lot, middleman standing between the two and those services is not entirely focussed on development and more. But the goal of this app is to provide all the freedom to the IT community.



Update: The app is halfway there. If, at the end, it turns out not to be popular, then I won't consider it as a waste. At least it will belong to one of my hobby projects.",r3p6jm

The created mutant will do its work, effectively if people live their life normally, and at the same time protecting them.

Ice Cubes Made Out of the Stuff You‚Äôre Drinking,36,"In restaurants, we oftentimes see our drinks being filled to brim with ice. Now, this isn‚Äôt too big of a problem at first, and it isn‚Äôt a problem at all for water, but if you‚Äôre not quick enough to drink your Pepsi, lemonade or whatever you‚Äôre drinking, the ice in your glass begins to melt and after a while, your drink becomes this heavily watered down beverage that tastes nothing like what your originally ordered.

The solution to this problem is rather simple actually. Ice is made of water, and therefore, if you‚Äôre drinking a glass of ice water, the ice that melts just becomes water again, and tastes exactly the same. If that is the case, if the icy material is intended to keep the drink cold but will eventually melt anyways, then why not make the ice cubes themselves out of the drink you‚Äôre drinking?

For example, imagine if we created ice cubes made of lemonade rather than water. You could then put them into a glass of lemonade, and even though the ice cubes would eventually start to melt, the drink would still taste the same because the material that makes up the ice that is melting into the drink is the same material as the drink itself!

Now, bearing in mind the various different freezing points of certain beverages, it may be required to introduce some kind of chemical that can raise/lower the melting/freezing point of a material. However, considering that most sodas and beverages are primarily made up of water, this could be effectively erased.

Basically, in the dream, I said something that was kind of racist, but didn't mean it to be racist. The black guy I was standing next to immediately went to play rock paper scissors with me and I met his draw. I lost and everyone started laughing together.

It was almost like a ""if you lose you're a racist"" game and it added some lightheartedness to a topic that desperately needs it. (Not that racism isn't serious).

I was thinking that this could be sort of a meme for if anyone ever said anything racist, and people around them called it out. Assuming there was an underlying ""I didn't mean it that way"" tone to the perpetrator's defense, he and the ones that called him out could immediately go to draw to prove it. All of it could be a little joke. If you lose, ""ha ha, you're a racist and you meant it to be racist."" If you win, you are vindicated.
