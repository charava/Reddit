Gravity powered generators,3,"I had thus idea a while back around 2009 when worked at a wood shop and was carrying two 5 gallon buckets of laqour thinner. Anyways I looked it up at the time and there were a coupke results. One was a lamp called Gravia that when you lifted a weight it would fall and spin a rod that had an ( i assume) dc motor connected at the bottom and it lit up. That lamp used a ball screw mechanism to do that.

A company in 2012 had a website for plans to build two huge cylindrical holes in the ground that were some how connected to each other. In each shaft they would have a weight; when one fell it would create a vacuum in the other shaft lifting the other weight to the top as it fell to the bottom. They said that this was achieved with a special device that would ve placed where the two chambers were connected.

I am just throwing this idea out there incase others are interested in experimenting with it. Some might say it cant work or that the ones that do arent that efficient or practical, but just think of the early days of electricity and generators. First electricity was just a novelty playful thing then as more people began to play with it it progressed into the first generator which people had no clue what it could be used for then.

I think in a youtube video he shows how to make one i tried but it didnt work for me but then again im not very skilled.

Buses should be delivery vehicles too.,3,"So the ideas i'm hearing from places like amazon and UPS is that they want to use robots to complete the ""last mile"" and ""last 70 feet"" of the delivery process.  It got me thinking.

Buses are a vehicle that often run a scheduled route through many neighbourhoods where deliveries and pickups need to be made.  Theres also peak and off peak times when their uses can be over or under utilized, which becomes a large waste of energy.  They also regularly connect to transportation hubs.  There is also a need to increase revenue to subsidize and lower ridership fees.

So my proposal:   Modify a transit vehicle to have collapsible seating, use the empty space to make off-peak deliveries by smaller robotic vehicles.  Modify transit hubs to also deal with delivery logistics.  Minimize the need for a transit vehicle to only have one purpose, making it struggle to create revenue and good fuel efficiency during off peak times for passengers by allowing robotic deliveries to happen... Which coincidentally is prime delivery times as the recipients are most likely to be home as well.

Build a delivery robot that can navigate a neighbourhood from this transit vehicle, be transported in a compact, efficient and modular way, to a transit stop to a front door, and back (bonus if it can carry a passenger!)  On top of this..  if it can make store pickups it can help retail stores connect with customers faster.

The future of transit needs to take into account ALL of the reasons we need to travel.  Not just be a people mover, but a stuff mover too.

In the longer term, it can be modified to handle loads of a larger size, or for specialized needs, like those in trades and services.  It can even lead to more frequent service, or even transit with more flexible route determination based on rider and package destinations.  The technology is here already, we just need to put the right heads together.",ebr9ps

A way to make android gaming controls more usable and similar to console.,0,"Is there a way to use the movement of your device to trigger onscreen buttons? Let's say you are playing an emulator and the original console controls required the use of 4 different inputs at once. Two thumbs and then a finger on each trigger. Many games use controls like this, and it's why playing shooters on the phone feels so clunky. When using on screen controls you can only use your two thumbs thus making it uncomfortable to properly play. For example take Minecraft. You look and move around with the joysticks, then attack or place blocks with the triggers, enabling you to simulataniously move whilst interacting. This is a critical factor in immersiveness and general playability of the gaming experience. When your control inputs are limited as they are on touchscreen devices, it forces games to adapt and change, often making console ports hard to enjoy, however creating an interesting variety of unique controls for other games that perhaps were originally designed around this flaw.

Specifically targeting emulators and console ports; games not designed around this flaw in controls, in my opinion this side of things could really do with a way of getting around this problem as it would vastly improve the enjoyability of playing (proper) games on the phone. My solution involves using the accelerometer & gyroscope to detect when the phone was being tapped on the top corners or back, and then mapping these input signals to control a touch button on the display, thus creating artificial trigger buttons for your emulator's.

You would simply hold the phone in a landscape position in a similar way to how you would hold a regular gaming controller, with your fingers resting on the top left and right corners of the screen. Just give them a good tap and that's your button. Surely the phones sensors are sensitive enough for that to be enough to trigger an onscreen reaction. Granted, this would not be a perfect solution as it would only really allow you to tap the triggers and not hold them down, however this could surely be somewhat mitigated by using a combination of all of your phones sensors to detect a purposeful input. The microphone would be able to detect a sound transient upon contact, as well as your gyroscope detecting subtle movements in orientation. Perhaps an extremely subtle flick of the phone toward whichever trigger you wish to press, in conjunction with the tap detected by the microphone, would be the best way to grant this method consistentcy as well as true functionality, via the added support of several sensors working together to detect intentional input.

Would this work, and is it already simple and easy to do with apps currently available?",rbs5ja

You get to rate with stars and you’ll have a rank of 1-5 stars as well as a recommend/wouldn’t recommend dating. Reviews would be kept anonymous. The details would be up to the individual as that’s your choice what you’re willing to share as it could potentially expose who you are.

An app that tells you when an NSFW scene is coming up in a movie.,16,"Here me out right, you in a theater watching a P13 or R rated movie with your parents and BOOM a big 45 and half second, full on nude, rough sex scene with loud moaning comes on and catches you off guard.

So you click on the movie, time you are watching it and the app will vibrate in a certain pattern to distinguish it from a regular notification. That will let you know what's good what's good, you should leave to the bathroom now or where you want to go. Then the app will vibrate when that scene is over, so you can go back to your seat.

""Why you're going to the bathroom so many times during the movie?""

I wanna 3D chip/PLA printer.,1,"It should be possible to have a 'four color' 3D printer (P,N,Conductor,non-conductor) chip maker that uses chemical vapor deposition to fabricate integrated chips onto pre-made chip blanks.  Maybe more 'colors' for other specialized components, too... for a deluxe model, to integrate capacitors and inductors and such.  Analog circuits come in handy, after all.

I remember a few articles from long ago about someone doing something like making circuits with an inkjet printer, but nothing for well over 20 years since.  I guess those college students graduated and entered the workforce to pay for their college debts.

Anyways, you'd buy bulk chip blanks with pins preset and pre-soldered onto connection points on a piece of bank, clean silicon (or other substrate), and build up chips like a 3D printer makes other models.  It could use pre-doped/mixed compounds as 'wire' for the P/N junctions, metal wire for the conductor, and something else for the non-conductor.  These would be in separate heads/'pens' to be used for the various stages.  The machine would pause, pick up another 'pen' (wire preloaded/threaded) and continue printing the next layer.  (Which would be a nice feature even for pure plastic 3D printers.)

Since it would deposit vapor from heating/arcing/whatever the materials and shooting them at the chip surface, it wouldn't use any chemicals, but it would probably need some kind of vapor catcher for the gases being drawn out of it by the vaccum.  Otherwise, it would be 'clean' compared to the (sometimes) horrific stuff you need to etch with, to make chips.  All additive.  (Or maybe even just specialized plastics?)

So, you'd design the circuit, put it into the software, connecting up the pin inputs/outputs, the software would simulate, recommend reconfigurations and figure out the optimal order of printing, you say OK, and it starts laying down material, layer by layer, just like 3D printers do.

It would be extremely low resolution compared to the techniques measured in nanometers, but for 99% of things outside of cameras and computers and solid state storage, it really doesn't need to be high resolution, nor does it really matter being super fast in every application.  If you're a hobbyist or developer, it should be accessible and a lot more compact and affordable and convenient than buying bulk transistors and other parts, and playing with breadboard when prototyping.  Plus of course, downloading shit and making it for grins.

You could even have the chip blank anchored into the machine in its own chip socket(s), so it could be tested and probed from outside without putting the cap on or opening the machine up.  Though if you built it up pretty high, you'd probably need its own air tent, and a way to reach in and put a custom cap on manually.

When you think about space colonies and replacement parts, do you really want some crucial chip to blow out twice, and then wait half a year (or more) for a replacement you ordered from Earth?

Sure would be nice if you could print up a replacement in a couple of hours without stocking and transporting harmful chemicals.

It could also (conceivably) print chips in 3D, somewhat overcoming the low resolution problems.  If you go for something like 100 micrometer scale, you could still pack a million transistors into one cubic centimeter.  It'd have to be real low power, though.  (Minus losses for purely structural parts and conductors and whatnot.)

Even at 1mm scale, 1000 transistors/elements in a 1cm block would be attainable.  Or print some bigger transistors as amplifiers/drivers, and such.  So making an 8 bit CPU or SOC would need a couple of centimeters of 1mm cubed voxels.  Maybe voids for airflow/cooling, structural elements, a shell and various other things.  Anyway, when talking mid tower desktop PC scale, you could get a non-trivial amount of computer working by PACKING that volume of space, even at such low resolution.  [There are already open source RISC projects.](https://openrisc.io/)  So why not download a new computer?

Work problems...,9,"So I work at an elementary school through Americorps right? When the schools closed down, the principal (one of my bosses) asked me to check in every day with the vice-principal, Minh. I asked if we could make it a weekly check-in but the vice principal said since principal said we gotta do every day, it's what I have to do.

Well, I did forget some days of the week to check-in. And so my Americorps Supervisor calls me to yell (rant) at me for it.

She's been very inconsistent with the requirements with this whole check-in even though I'm checking in with just the vice principal and not her. Our check-ins are separate. Mind you her job is to make sure I'm doing my job at the school which is why shes concerned with the check-in between me and the vice principal.

In April, since I forgot a couple more days, she called again. And ranted over and over how I'm not professional and even threatening to fire me because I'm being so unprofessional for not checking in with the vice principal. She told me she doesn't care what time I check in just as long as I do it? Since my work at home hrs have been so...all over the place.

Technically it was our Spring Break when I forgot that time so I didn't it was such a big deal.

Well, today she called (EVEN THOUGH I HAVE CHECKED IN every day) and RANTED OVER AND OVER how so I'm so unprofessional and how my check-in times are so late. I asked her what time does she want me to check-in? And I didn't get a specific time. So I send my daily check in to vice-principal and say ill be checking in at 1 pm every day. Then she texts me and says ""NO the requirement is 12:00pm""

She's being very inconsistent with her requirements and expectations and I'm getting sick of her threatening to fire me over this stupid check-in.

Hearing someone call you unreliable, unaccountable, unprofessional, etc. over and over. I cried during our call but I muted it bc I was trying so hard to stay professional.

She said she will not be my reference for whatever job I may be getting next...mind you, I never asked her to.

I don't know what to do. I want to report this to her boss and talk to my vice principal but I don't how to explain it to them.

Thank you for reading this whole thing...I really could use some professional advice on this if there is anything I can do.",g2x57f
I'm stuck in another country with my mom and step-father who apparently can't stop fighting each other,13,"Hi

Well, I'm originally from South America, I live there with my dad. This February I had to come to Europe, where I lived in for seven years before I went back to my country, so I could help my mom take care of my little brothers until she recovered from a serious surgery. My step-father and her are separated, he usually stays in another city because of work and then comes to the city my mom lives in for two weeks so he can see the kids. That's all good, it works for them, but quarantine messed things up, since my step-dad can't go back to the city. My mom and him fight absolutely all the time, sometimes it's over serious problems and sometimes over really small things. It has been like this since I was 13 years old (I'm currently 21), that's why they separated.

The thing is, all of this is taking a toll on my mental health and I haven't been able to go back to my country. The embassy and airline won't answer my emails. I'm getting sick of it, plus I'm starting online classes.

I don't know how I will manage to stay sane. I've tried talking to them calmly, yelling, putting on my headphones on full volume so I can't hear them, going to another room but it doesn't work since the apartment is tiny and I don't have a bedroom for myself.

What can I possibly do? I'm genuinely desperate.",g2oc25
Online school (not serious),5,"This is very mild, and will probably make me sound bratty, but here we go. I had a science project I had to hand in, and usually my teacher would pester us to hand in every part of the assignment (understandably). But because of online school, I forgot to. I handed in the main assignment, but forgot all my research notes. What’s stranger is that I handed in the works cited on a separate page, but had no notes attached. When I got the mark back, I noticed the big fat 0 next to the research notes. I put a lot of effort into them, so I assume I would’ve gotten perfect. My mark would’ve went from an 81% to a 95%, and it infuriates me. I’ve always been soft and broke down at the smallest thing, so this made me very sad, then angry, then quiet. I know this isn’t even really a problem, but it could’ve been avoided if Corona wasn’t happening. Stay safe, do your work, hand it in, wash your hands. I want this whole mess to be over soon.",g2nycw
"im fat, depressed and tired and imma blame it on the lockdown :)",8,"ok so this quarantine has completely fucked me over



i started out with the intent to exercise, but due to my extreme procrastination that plan has been completely flushed, and i (believe i) have packed on a decent amount of fat that wasnt there beforehand. on top of this, i have insomnia, and i never take sleeping pills as they leave me with a migraine, so if i do sleep, its 4am or later. my body seems to have calibrated itself to wake up at 3pm because of this, giving me no time to do ANYTHING.

so, i need either ways to motivate myself, or very easy and quick workouts, and ways to sleep without pills.

any tips? honestly im open to try anything right now. hell, ill even try home remedies.",g26zrr

I feel like i have to speak about this to someone but i feel like there really isn't anybody that is feeling the same. Similar yes for sure.  I just need to get this off my mind.

So my mom and dad wasn't like married together when my mom got pregnant but they did know each other for looong time since childhood so it wasn't like a one night thing you know. But he took off and my mom find out that he had a child coming a few moths away from my birth.  He chose not to be in my life than. So i never saw him. I had one picture of him but i lost it.

2017 He joined to Facebook and messaged to my mom. He asked how i was doing and if i wanted to see him on Saturday. He was going to some amusement park whit my two brothers. That Saturday i had school and i had this important role to host the event there so i couldn't go. After that he didn't ask to meet again. And why he contacted my mom was and i quote ""My wife died and that kinda woke me up that everything is not forever"" he said. I friended him on Facebook too but he never talked to me, just my mom. In 2019 he posted MY name and my 3 brothers names tattooed on his fingers. And i remind you i have never talked to this man before. Few months later he post the ""In a relationship"" thing in Facebook and weeks later deletes Facebook and i and my mom lost all contact to him. He took off again.

I'm not sad about it just mad. Because i let him to make me believe that something was going to happen but nothing did.  One thing that i kinda would want is relationship whit my brothers but than i don't want anything to do whit them or my dad. It's just all really confusing...

My close friends for three years in high school are cutting me off,7,I have three best friends throughout my high school life. After many bad experience with friendship groups and drama. I have finally found my close friends in high school which is my ex three close friends now. How it all started in my opinion and what I’m about to express is what I feel like happened and it could be different on what they have seen or what their side of the story could be. I first met two of my best friends in the end of year 7 when I was bullied with my other toxic friendship groups and when I first met them they were very nice and understanding. They would tell me they would always be here whenever I have problems and they always listened to me complain or rant about my family problems or issues in my life time. I would sometimes make funny jokes like for example how people act and stupid dad jokes. They all laughed and they would always hype me up for the jokes I made and it actually made me happier that someone could finally understand me for who I am. So then my jokes got more funnier and they would laugh more louder. After one year pasted my two close friends made friends with another girl and she joined our group and to be honest at first I disliked her and was jealous of her because she was used to be from the popular group and I hated the way she acted. While I started to feel excluded and left out of the group. So I told my two close friends about how I felt and they completely Ignored my opinion. Pretending nothing has happened. While days kept going on I stoped mentioning my problems about the new girl in our group and started to communicate with her and hang out with her more often thinking then I would be able to fit in more. But as time went she’s actually gorgeous and an out going person and I actually got closer with her more than my other two best friends. The four of us are all having fun and talk together through out our last year of high school. Soon time went out and things started to go down. My problems got worse and I would want people to listen to my thoughts I try not to always complain to them about it and I would often hear them complaining about things in their life’s and I found it equal because that’s what friends do. But then soon I found out that my friends are once again distancing themselves with me. I tired to find reason and I learn from my past mistakes in other friendship groups until I finally said it out to them that I felt left out again. Then they finally all stood up and talked about the problems but it never came to a conclusion because everyone was just crying about the situation and ranting out all my mistakes and they never talked about their own. They told me they are sick of me ranting. They are sick of my jokes because it makes them feel uncomfortable and weird about themselves. But I found it really weird because they never told me instead blaming the problems all on me and telling me how I am the person causing all the dramas in this friendship group. But that’s not my intention to cause drama. I just wanted to make them happy and laugh so all my jokes are just to make them happy when they are upset and my problems I could not talk about it again only if you guys could of told me earlier. Instead of telling me at the end the year when everyone is gonna graduate soon. They said that my problems are affecting their own mental health and it’s killing them and they are sad because they have enough problems on their mind too. But I hate the fact that they didn’t tell me and I asked them that too and what they told me was they hide it away from me thinking they will get judged about their opinions on things if they stated their opinions on things I did or said and it made me really really upset. Because I thought we were all best friends and if we talk about things and if we don’t like it you have to say it out because then none of us will change for the better. It made me feel like a shit head that I am not counted as a friend because they hide their most important thoughts in things away from me. I could still remember that day where all four of us were crying our brains out. But all their problems were targeted towards me that I am the problem and drama causer. That day was the last day of school since the school got shut down the next day because of the coronavirus going on. So none of us get to solve or talk it out. So I send them each are very very important text message and explained my wrong and hope they would accept my apology. But instead they turned really cold to me and started to lash out everything on how I made their life’s horrible and things are never gonna be the same anymore. It’s a build up problem because since year 7 they would laugh in my jokes and told me that they would always listen and be by my side when problems rises and I know people do change over time but these words hurt me the most that my friends are leaving me because of me trying my hardest to fit in. I apologised for what I did in the past to create this problem. But they never apologised for the words they said or called me. That’s what made me sad and proud at the same time. That I admitted what I did wrong in this friendship even though I think I really didn’t because it was a misunderstanding of communication since they NEVER told me what they are thinking. But I can also understand them at the same time because it’s hard to tell one of your friends about this. I admit what I did and I’m proud of that. They didn’t do it and it’s ok because everyone has their own choice. It’s their Choice to do what they think is correct and in the end they decided to cut me of. They said we can acquaintances but every time when I text them like “hi” or “how are you” they Igrone me or leave me on read. I realised that just some things that caused them to turn completely cold to me. I guess In the future I will learn from my mistakes and find a true friend who will understand me better than high school.,g1r9qq
Brother,5,This is my first time telling anyone about this so my older brother scares me when we were younger he would do anything in his power to keep my mouth shut about him dipping or smoking he’d pin me down on the floor and hit me and as time went on it got worse one day he just came in my room and just started hitting me  as his friends just watch in the doorway and more recently he’s been getting into drugs and cussing out my mom and threatening to kill me to get money out of my mom luckily i did get out of these situations mostly unharmed ever since then I’ve been having nightmares about him killing me or my little brother and it feels like it might happen this whole situation with my brother has caused a lot of problems for me and I don’t what to do,g1eixl

I hate my family (especially my brother) I wish he can just disappear or something,6,"I don’t want to be mean or selfish but I think I am  now because I am gonna put it here about how shitty and nasty my younger brother is. On all the shit he has caused me and made me who I am now. How many of my fucking mental health are linked from what he had done. My family were always fighting and we’re very violent with each other so since when I was young. I had many bad experience with it and I hated home. I use to think I lived in such a perfect life. Not until my brother was born. His two faced since when he was young. He would show his cute innocent side to my mum or dad or anyone in the family tree just to get sympathy and love. While he treats me and my younger sister with disrespect and hate. He would spit on me every time when I get out of the shower clean. Throw dirt on my clean washed blanket thinking it’s so fun to see my reaction. Pick his nose and wipe it at me. Bite his toe nail and throw it at me or in my room when I’m not around. Wear his dirty shoes and jump on my bed. Mess up my clean laundry. Use his dirty hands to touch me and It caused me to have a trauma that my things will never get clean if I’m around that shit head and it turned me into a psycho clean freak that wants everything to be clean. Since he is the second oldest and is the only boy in the three children I found that my love in this family were gone. I’m the oldest and in the Asian family you were expected to do many things for the family. My brother was a little spoiled brat he gets money from my dad and my grandparents since he is the only boy so he is pretty much biased around the family tree. While my younger sister is the youngest so she needs more care and you could say I was jealous that all my love and care was all gone just because I was the oldest I had to work three jobs and the money I earn we’re either taken away by my parents to buy stuff for my brother and sister. I don’t want to live such a horrible life. Even words can’t explain my feelings right now. My brother he swears a lot around the house hold and my parents don’t care because he is spoiled like I said. He would always boss me to be his slave and he will hit me  or pull my hair whenever he doesn’t like something. He takes my stuff without Permission and breaks my books destroy my makeup and items in my room. He yells all the time and one time mum and dad was always fighting about him. Such as one time when my dad cooked him noodles and he doesn’t like it and he started to throw a tantrum mum came and started to yell at my dad because of a cup of noodle on how my brother didn’t like the taste. Such a petty thing to fight for. That day I was the one who had to stop them from fighting and I was protecting my mum from my dad beating her. My brother is too spoiled and that time he was 13 years old. Still acting like a baby. When he was younger about 6 or 7 years old every time when he does something wrong I would get blamed for it since I’m the oldest and I would get hit and beat up. I turned suicidal after many beat up and harassment from my brother and parents. My brother would stole money from my parents and use it for his stupid game. He would take my parents credit card and type in the number and spend about $700 dollars on a freaking game. When he was younger he would stole candies from shops and eggs from our next door neighbours. He takes things with out permission. Every time when I’m sad I would take some animals home, such as rabbits and cat and look after them and put them in our garden.  My brother would harass my cat and play with it really rough and when my cat attacks him for it he would kick my cat. He even stole my bunny rabbit ‘Pluto’ and he will threaten me with many things if he doesn’t get what he wanted because my parents has his back. I would get mad at him and tell him to stop because I’m not a very patient person because I hate my brother since he was young. So some times I would yell at him and tell him to back off for all the shit things he do but then he runs off and acts all innocent to my mum or dad and I would get beat again and yelled at. I just don’t understand. My brother had stole and had break many things in this house hold but my parents just never gets mad at him rather think his doing is good. His never going to learn his lesson and soon he will be raised to be a criminal. Since he is the only boy my parents would never do anything to hurt him and he never had to wash any of his clothes or do any kind of chores around the house. Rather I had to do many things. I hate living my life like this. Really hate it and wish some days it could end.",g10x4e

Past HS drama,0,"So a long time ago in high school, idk why I ever did this I was being really dumb and I regret and I can not stop thinking about this till this day. But I had 2 friends who always talked behind their backs to me. I told my friends that both of them were talking bad about eachother and one of my friends wanted evidence because she thought I was lying. One day my friend talked bad about another friend so I decided to record the conversation and send it. Currently this is the past and these 2 aren’t friends due to other reasons but the friend I recorded knows I did this and she does forgive me. However, the friend that I gave the recording to in high school, her mom is totally crazy and she emailed my high school teacher saying my friend and I bullied the friend in high school. To this day I worry that I made a big mistake by recording the conversation and it will later impact our lives. However I know it’s just high school drama and everyone does talk behind others back. So I’m scared that the mom will like show everyone or the friend that I sent the recording to will show everyone and my other friend will be affected and so will I...
This happened like 3-4 years ago but I still think to this day I made a bad mistake. Please give me some advice or thoughts.",g06k98

A problem I had for two years,3,"Before I went into middleschool, I was a happy little kid that would always talk to others and make goofy and funny things to make others laugh. Some of the kids that I mess with don't really have a problem with me and sometimes would ask me if I would like to play games in the playground like the floor is lava, tag, and hide n seek. Other kids however (that were mostly girls), saw me as a annoying kid who does dumb things and doesn't know any better. So the girls rarely ever talked to me. Sometimes I would be arguing with some girls since they would act defensive and would sometimes tease for the things I do. Luckily I had a very nice teacher and would diffuse the situation quickly. The girls will sometimes tease me for the things, but it didn't really bother me since me and my friend would always laugh it off. But then, once my elementary days were over and I had to go a middle school for the first time, things got pretty bad.

Once my first day of middle school began, I was sort of shy and didn't really talked that much since my friend from elementary school was going to a different middle school so I had no friends to talk to. My first impression to my classmates wasn't that good, I acted pretty retarded to them as of what I've done to make kids in my elementary school laugh. Once lunch began,
I sat in a small table were couple of my classmates were sitting in. I attempt to make ""funny"" things that I deeply regret doing like eating things of the floor, eating
scraps of food that my classmates didn't want, and make weird jokes that weren't really funny at all. Worst part about my classmates was that some of them were girls that were from my elementary school. The girls didn't really like me at all and started spreading rumors about me that would later destroy my reputation with my classmates. Another bad thing about my classmates is a small group of ghetto kids that weren't really nice to others. Once they heard about the rumors, they pretty much started tormenting me everyday calling me names, stealing some of my belongings, and even sometimes threatening me that they were gonna beat me up. I felt powerless because of them. Around the middle of the school year, everyone was pretty much against me, they all pretended I had some disease which they called Ebola and started physically distancing themselves from me, pretty much causing me to be lonely for the rest of the school year. It gotten so bad to a point where everytime
I sit near to ant of my class, they would scooch away from me or tell to please sit somewhere else. I would also pretend I was sleeping on the table while in reality I was quietly sobbing from all this torment I had to deal
with every day. Onetime one of the ghetto kids was mad at me for something that I can't remember and started calling names and other bs at me. I then snapped and threw a small milk carton at him and it hit him in his. After this, he told me that me and him are going to fight in bathroom. I was pretty mad at him so I pretty much shrugged it off. Then when my class period started he came to my table and told to follow him into the bathroom. I knew what he was doing so told him no. Then he brought his friend and tried to encourage me to follow him to the bathroom. I got angry at him and quietly threw a cuss word at him. He heard me though, and got pissed off and decided to shove my workbook off my desk. Luckily my teacher finally realizes whats going and stopped the ghetto kid from harassing me. But at that point, I hit my breaking point and started sobbing onto the desk. That day was the day were my personality started to drastically change. After my school uear was finally over and I moved on to 7th grade. I was no longer that happy kid that would always attempt to make funny jokes to make other people laugh. I was now just some kid that barely talked to other.

As of writing this now, Im now a lot more energetic than before and now have friends that I would sometimes talk. But I still don't talk that much to others since I fear that they would gonna tell me to shut up or say that they don't care what im talking. Sometimes though, I would fight off my anxiety by telling myself that if they don't care about the things I say, then just move on and say something else. I would also have these episodes where my confidence to do anything just goes down the drain and their will voices of my classmates in my head telling that whatever I was doing is dumb or tell me that my opinions are dumb.

Sorry you had to hear my long ass sob story about me. Hopefully some of yall can give some advice to deal with my anxiety and these episodes I have.",fxkty1

IDEA company,4," Why isn't there a company that invests in ideas? Like raw ideas?

Currently  the first line of investment is held by venture capitals or crowdfundings. But at the very very least they need a grown idea with a  good business plan and nobody is interested in ideas that come from  people who don't have the luxury or the time to get it to those steps.

Imagine  a truck driver. He is driving and he thinks to himself why something  that could help him with a specific situation and this is common amongst  truck drivers? Or a local man in a poor country that sees the potential  that is lying there but no one sees the opportunity and eventually poor  man forgets it and leaves it behind (has happened to me).

Some  people don't have the luxury of resources in rich countries but they do  have great ideas that can make money! It's baffling to me that no  company has been created for this purpose. If I had the money I would've  built it.

On the other hand we have these sham companies that take your money to promote your idea but nothing comes out of it.

I  think to myself if someone had money he would take ideas for free, examine them and if they were good and executable then they give the  person with the idea a portion of the shares of the joint company that  is made to promote and execute that idea.

You'd  think most of it will be useless and people will not generate enough  good material to make profit but see how successful crowdbased platforms  like twitter, facebook, reddit have become. Or how multiplayer gaming  is a good proof with regular people in the action ideas are way better  originated and it will become such a successful business.",rbvnwf

An Idea for a single shot slasher film,0,"An elderly lady pulling her suitcase by its handle approaches the sergeant at the front desk of a police station. She waits until he notices her and asks how he can help her.
She replies ""I have been having a problem with the neighbourhood kids."" She drops her beheaded dead cat on the counter. ""They killed my cat and forced me out of my house.""

The film then plays in reverse following her backwards down the street past the crowds of people going about their lives back through alley ways where she is avoided even by violent criminals and eventually we get to her house now on fire. She enters the house which exploded in flames in reverse. We follow her to a kitchen where she puts food wrapped in newspaper into the suitcase from the countertop. We follow her out of the kitchen where she closet where she retrieved her suitcase. We follow her back to the kitchen where she chops up fresh meat into cuts and wraps them up in newspaper.
She carries meat from the kitchen backward down into a cellar where she dismembers bodies of teenagers fighting them to the death with a meat cleaver who she finds have broken in through a cellar window and are searching for things to take.",rauju0

Trashcan with a censor that has the ability to sense the type of object it is and dump it into one of its two baskets (recyclable/not) accordingly,0,People often are unsure whether or not the item they are throwing out is recyclable. What ends up happening is that items that should be recycled are put in the typical bin and that items that should be put in the typical bin are recycled.

What we could do instead is attach a censor using [existing technology](https://medium.com/deepquestai/train-object-detection-ai-with-6-lines-of-code-6d087063f6ff) to a bin. It will identify whether the object should be recycled or not and dump it into one of its two baskets accordingly.,r9y2rk

App that shows how other people would say something:,2,"Almost constantly we hear people respond with boring phrases such as “that’s so cool”, “wow- really” and “not much, you?”. The truth is, this type of dialog is boring and adds nearly nothing to a convo. Most people, even if they’re interested in the conversation, can lack the creativity to say a tailor made reply.

     That is where this app would help change that. A vocabulary of words is no good if they can’t be arranged into a vocabulary of phrases. People will often lack a reply and resort to something they say frequently, then ask themselves: “How else could I have said that?”

     This has the potential be a very good network app- if designed correctly. My vision would be a simplistic and minimalist “Reddit” style chat room, where a phrase or question can be posted between quotations. Other users can then post on the phrase how they would say the phrase in they’re own words.

     Posting responses will give a string of comments in order of the best user rated synonymous phrase. Any question, phrase or one-liner could be posted, helping people improve their vocabulary of things to say daily during conversation.",rf53e7
Request: iOS app that allows you to use iPhone or iPad as Sony Camera monitor through lightning cable,1,"We invest a lot of money in our Sony cameras at all professional tiers, from the under $1,000 mirror less cameras to the big sensor cinema cameras. We also invest a lot of money into our phones and tablets. Then, we spend more to purchase monitors (the ones that attach to your camera, not your computer) that we can use in various ways with our cameras.

The hardware in our iPhones and iPads are more than enough to handle anything a professional monitor could do and even has editing apps that have a lot of the simple editing features that simple videos that only need, like Adobe rush or even iMovie.

In addition, the ability to use the iOS device as an SSD would be amazing too, as it would cut down on a lot of extra steps in workflow and create instant iCloud update. But with all that, the monitor part seems like something that should already exist.

Sony’s imaging edge app is insanely horrible with my a6400 and is missing some of the features that only exist on the camera’s touchscreen for some reason that many of you could definitely explain better than me.

Unionization as a service,7,"Provide easier routes to start a union, possible features might include:

\- Easy access to organizers who can reach out to other employees within the company and begin organizing without the initiator worrying about retribution (or dealing with work politics)

\- Anonymous (but still verified) chat groups where employees can organize without worrying about screenshots and identities being leaked to management

\- Report, document, and publish union busting tactics

\- Election petition filing

\- Fundraising

\- Connect organizers with marketing resources for larger campaigns

EDIT additional why:

Now that we live in such a politically polarized environment it's extremely taboo to bring up subjects that relate to politics or political identity. This has a paralyzing effect on the ability of employees to organize together and represent themselves. What are the current viable options for organizing? Walking around your office and asking everyone how they feel about unions? Sure, you could also send friend requests on Facebook to every single one of your coworkers but that has far worse consequences than simply being fired, plus you lose all anonymity.

Organizing is really difficult and not often a skill possessed by those working generally in the labor market, nobody should be left out of the benefits of unionization because they lack people skills, charisma, or social standing. By reducing the risk for employees involved the service should give meaningful access to one of our most valuable rights.",rduoge
Taskified - Gamified Tasks,8,"I was thinking about developing an app with gamification elements for a long time.
couple pf days ago i encountered a problem with my son who didn't want to do some chores and thought about this idea:

a parent - child app where parents can post tasks, each completed task rewards the child who finished it with points, those points can be converted to rewards that parent posted also.

some user stories i thought about:
parent side:
 can assign task to all of his children or an individual.
 can add gifts / rewards to be redeemed with points
 can track task / child proccess
 can assign a deadline for a task


child side:
 can take a task disabling it to other children
 can redeem points to gifts / rewards
 can earn predetermined amount of pts for each day (or maybe day streaks or something)
 earns badges / unlock achievements / leveling up

Elagant Concept for a Simple Thought-to-Text Device! Feasable?,1,"The inspiration for this invention came from a friend of mine who mentioned the interesting and seemingly plausible fact that electrodes implanted in a part of the body such as a single finger could detect micro-vibrations when a subject merely concentrated on the intention to move that finger, even when no visible motion of the finger was acted out.

Now, imagine if we chose 26 body parts- say, 10 fingers plus some toes, elbows, knees, shoulders, ect. and attached 26 of these ""intention-triggered"" electrode sensors to them.

Then, we assign a letter of the alphabet to each sensor which instantly displays the triggered body-part/letter as text visible on a computer screen or on an Augmented Reality visor.

I think you can extrapolate where this is going....

The subject would need to be trained to use the device rapidly, of course, as if learning a new language.

But eventually, there would be fluency. Let's say the right pointer finger was assigned the letter ""A"" and the subject was asked to think the word ""Apple"". At first, they would think ""Okay, Apple starts with an ""A""... which body-part was ""A"" assigned to? ...Oh yeah, it was my right pointer finger."" Then they would not even scrunch up that finger as if typing a keyboard, but merely imagine doing so. Presumably, that electrode would detect the micro-vibrations in those nerves too small to even see a visible movement of the finger. The letter ""A"" appears on the screen or visor. Then they would continue with ""P"", ""P"", etc.

At first the process would be prohibitively slow, and the required body-part would need to be concentrated on intensly. But as the subject gained fluency, they would eventually reach a point where the body-part to letter process would become subconscious. Meaning, they wouldn't even need to consciously think ""Oh yeah, my right knee is ""Q"", so I must imagine moving my right knee."" They would merely think of the letter ""Q"", and due to their training and sheer muscle-memory, their right knee nerves would be subconsviously activated and ""Q"" would appear, for all practical purposes instantly and is if directly from their mind to the screen.

I imagine a very fluent subject would be able to think of a word and as they spelled it out in their minds the word would appear, possibly even faster than one could type it out manually, without the subject moving visibly at all, as if directly from ""Thought-to-Text"" (TM),

This device could have applications for disabled people like paraplegics or those in full-body casts, but I see it moreso intended as simply the natural evolution of the keyboard into something faster, more intuitive, more user-friendly and ""organic""/enjoyable to use.

I assume in a decade or two this form of typing would become the norm and physical keyboards would be phased out.

Also, as a bonus feature, the results assigned to each electrode would be user-variable like options assigned to buttons of a video-game controller. So, imagine instead of letters, each body-part could be assigned a color, or the note of a musical instrument. Thus, a visual artist could complete a color-by-number type painting with a ""Thought-to-Art"" Device (TM) or a musician with a ""Thought-to-Music"" Device.

Is there any logical reason this would not work with relatively simple and cheap technology we already have?

Open Source medical research without intellectual property. Etica Protocol,3,"Since 2018 I've been working on the creation of a blockchain Protocol for Open Source Medical research without intellectual property aka the Etica Protocol. [https://www.eticaprotocol.org](https://www.eticaprotocol.org)

Victor Hugo :  ""Nothing is More Powerful than an Idea Whose Time has Come""

I think the time for Etica has come, so let me share a brief presentation of Etica with you.

Brief presentation:

Etica aims to promote open source medical research without intellectual property. It incentivizes publication of research oriented papers (by professionals or not) for each disease added to the network.

Etica protocol has its own currency Etica (ETI). The protocol has a fixed inflation of about 2.5% per year. Thanks to this inflation it funds the curation rewards (for voters) and editor rewards (for creators of proposals).

It operates based on periods of 7 days. For each period a curation\_reward as well as an editor\_reward will be issued by the Protocol (respecting the 2.5% yearly inflation rate). For each period all users can submit Proposals in order to get a part of the editor\_reward  of the period. Etica token holders can submit and vote on proposals  using a staking system (They have to lock Eticas for 28 days in exchange  for bosoms). Bosoms are a unit of measure inherent to the protocol that is used by the voting system. All proposals can be voted upon for 3 weeks. After the voting duration has been passed the Protocol rewards or penalises participants based on the outcome of the votes.

The protocol is designed in such a way that only about 72% of proposals will be accepted. Thus due to open source competition the creators of proposals will have to improve the quality of their papers to get a proposals accepted by the network as things progress

The  creator of a proposal that was accepted by the network will be rewarded  with a part of the period's editor\_reward that will be proportional to  the amount of Eticas that was used by token holders to vote on the  proposal. If the proposal is rejected, depending on the level of the  rejection the creator of the proposal will have it's stack duration  increased (for instance 65 days) or even lose funds (to submit you have  to put a collateral of 10 ETI that you can lose if proposal is heavily  rejected by the network).

The  voters that vote on the wining side (can be either accepted or  rejected) will get a part of the curation\_reward proportional to the  amount of Eticas they have used to vote on the proposal. If they vote on  the losing side, their stack will be increased (for instance 84 days  longer) in proportion to the level of rejection.

Full details in the whitepaper.

The whitepaper:

The  Etica whitepaper (9 pages) describes how the protocol will operate in  details. (As Published and sent to the original Satoshi Nakamoto mailing  list in September 2019)

[https://eticaprotocol.org/viewwhitepaper](https://eticaprotocol.org/viewwhitepaper)

[The smart contract:](https://github.com/etica)

The Etica smart contract is on [github/etica](https://github.com/etica). It is a complexe smart contract that successfully implements everything described in the whitepaper  in the form of an Ethereum smart contract. If you are a developper or  you know ethereum developpers tell them to review this smart contract. I  have full confidence they will assess the quality of the code.

Etica is all about open source and creating a community based project with nobody having specific privileges.  Even if I started to work on Etica alone,  I understand the potential  of this project, it is much bigger than me and to succeed it needs to be completely decentralised from day 1.

This is why I want to underline these facts:

1. I plan to launch Etica in coming months from scratch as soon as there will be a community
2. There will be no premine
3. Anybody joining Etica will have same rights, aka I won't have any privilege nor anybody else
4. It is completely open source
5. It is a neutral protocol
6. There is no backdoor Key or Key with specific rights
7. The smart contract will be launched on its Blockchain (a Fork of Ethereum Proof of work)
8. The initial supply will be distributed trough mining
9. Mining will stop forever once we reach 21 Million Eticas (should take several years)
10. Then only the yearly inflation of 2.5% will generate new Eticas.

This stuff is not mine, it is all about building it together. Let's become Legends and Join [r/etica](https://np.reddit.com/r/etica/)

A non profit grocery store,15,"Somebody should make a non profit grocery store that buys directly from the supplier and then prices their groceries at cost. 

It would operate like a soup kitchen or food pantry, but it would recoup much (not all, staffing etc)of its expenses through the ultra low selling of the food items to people in need.

It would also allow families to shop with some sense of normalcy, which would be good for those who can afford to pay a little for their groceries but who struggle.

Idea: why isn’t there a interstate pipeline system for water?,22,"So I’ve been a CA resident for most of my life and every year there’s drought, and it’s getting worse and worse (climate change and stuffs).  
Recently I came to know of oil pipelines from Canada to Mexico (and their consequences). And I can’t help but wonder why isn’t there a pipeline of water from states with excessive water (Oregon and Washington, right next to CA) to CA, or anywhere that’s permanently drought?  
I understand there’s significant cost to build and maintain the pipeline but water is much safer than oil and you can always sell water to those farmers who keep crying coz CA can’t give them enough.  
Even when there’s a net loss to the gov, isn’t it worth it to ensure a stable water supply for every resident?",rhk025
"Lead plastic for optical use, especially for efficient light diffusers that spread light in controlled amount and angle. Or anything with high refraction index in contact with other transparent plastic. For blinders and curtains for example",1,"Surface filled with concave lenses can spread sunlight in convenient angles evenly. Surface with cones causes a ring-shape when looking at the surface and is different kind of option for softer shadows and milder light. Light ray deflection might be something between 10 and 60 degrees. Depends on the place and taste what to choose.

https://i.redd.it/k7wxunt3dt581.png

Light diffusion with random scattering to all directions is simple, but half of the light goes outside.

Pattern on any plastic works to some degree, but gathers dirt or needs other flat covering plastic. 2 interlocked plastic types is stronger and thinner when outside surfaces are flat. Different refractive index in plastic types causes deflection.

Some windows can have 2 rows of blinders, curtains or hatches: light blocking and light diffusing.

Lead glass is used somewhere, but is weaker than plastic. Maybe tungsten plastic would work? It is atomic physics what molecules are transparent and what not.",rhfwdj

2. An app where runners can join a team of runners. They can track their running progress, share messages about running, achievements, and photos.

Location based Social Media,1,"Ive hear similar ideas but it makes sense to me now in some environments. A social media where if you are in the predetermined location 'zone' you can upload photos/videos. You can also view anything else others post to that location and set time of event.

Use cases: Parties, weddings, concerts, etc.

This would be similar to snap locations however it is not as private and uses an algorithm/you have to have your snap settings set to public. And the big difference is anyone from any location can see snaps on the map in any desired location.

This would be a more private type of app. You would have to attend in order to see, post, and save.

Edit:

An admin could create the event setting the location zone and time span of the event. This would also prevent people from asking each other to 'share me the photos from the party'.",ri8i4n
Time saving bank card. Skip the faux security. (Idea),1,"Fast cash, Blink bucks, Dosh pass, Fast Chit, Skip Chit

I could make 100 of these names for a card that pretty much skips all of the questions at checkout and just pays mostly for smaller daily purchases.

Obviously first off Chip, NFC, and strip don't put my personal info on the card the limit is low and the security is high.

Skip the signing at restaurants.(Have a preset percentage for tipping you set on an app which can be changed before it clears. Blacklist places it's stupid to tip at)

Skip All the pin pad questions

 Skip the Pin/signing at check out. (Security features below)
 Skip the asking if you want cash back. (Just turn it off for the card)
 Skip the are you sure.
 Skip the do you agree to this fee.(have that one at the local commissary twice in a row now)
 Skip the do you want a stupid warranty for your 3$ bathroom scale.(Looking at you hellmart)
 Skip the donate to a charity (pisses me off anyway I'm not donating to your tax write off why is this a thing that I don't see called out more)
 Skip the receipt completely it goes to your bank. (From there it is with each purchase. Some places offer to send it to your email but about 50% of the time it doesnt pull the email from your card and now all the sudden you have to type it in on that garbage pin pad screen)

Integrate all your rewards cards (Google pay already does this and is fairly fast at walgreens)

Security features to ensure the easy card is not abused since by nature it should be blazing fast to use.All of these should be adjustable and optional features

 Every so often you must tap the card on your phone and the NFT re-enables it or even refills if you have a limit you are nearing.
 Location tracking

1. The card only work if its been near your phone in the last day or so.
2. A push notification if your card is moving too far away from your phone also adjustable distance.
3. Location based security levels highest being that it must be near your phone to work or the limit is reduced significantly. (So you can go in and grab a drink while you left your phone in the car.)

Initially when I thought of this I thought it would be an everyday card with a low daily limit that was fast but with the security options I've laid out this is likely more secure than mose cards. That being said some features to expand past the original scope

Online purchases

 Virtual cards for everything online (All of this can be done with privacy.com)

1. Wanna cancel that subscription but you can't do it online. Screw em the virtual card doesn't exist anymore also if they somehow try to contact you they say you died of  Pentapox or something\^(Likely not legal) (Should be illegal to allow someone to sign up for a service online but not cancel with the same ease)
2. Same with utilities in small towns that go past greedy human eyes (my electric company compromised my card twice now. No idea if this is just a small town problem)
3. Kinda sketched out by the security of a site just use a one time virtual card

Aesthetic  
Totally pointless but I want it to be a nondescript flat color and have the Skip icon on it.Personalize it all you want just can't add pictures copyright nightmare.

A penis vaporizer to eliminate the need to move to use the bathroom,1,"Okay Reddit, please, hear me out and tell me if you think such a thing is feasible or possible. 

A tube sized vape would be strapped to or suctioned upon the penis. The tube would be separated into two chambers, one a chamber to catch liquid, and the other filled with scented traditional vape juice or ozone. The idea would be that you could urine, in place, wherever you are. The tube would sense itself being filled up, and mix with the traditional scent or ozone to deodorize the smell and begin to vape off the liquid.

Once the tube had cooked off all the urine, it would vibrate in a pattern to let the user know that it was now ready for his next urine. 

Possible? Would you buy one if all you had to do was charge your penis vape to not have to get up to urinate in a given day?",dzjcd9

Need help! Very niche but potentially very important idea for handicap accessibility in water sports.,4,"Idea, followed by back story:

A device that give supplemental oxygen to people likely to lose consciousness or bodily control while in open water.

For sports like surfing, water skiing, jet ski, certain swimming sports, and even rowing, any disorder that causes loss of bodily control can mean certain death, and this excludes a huge number of people from enjoying these sports.

The best answer I can come up with must be:

1) portable
2) reliable for oxygen delivery
3) implement some type of ""dead man"" switch
4) be mostly unobtrusive

Story about why I want to make this:

I have been madly, deeply falling in love with a wonderful woman, who is a very talented and dedicated surfer. She has won awards and recognition in the sport. A short time ago, she started developing epileptic seizures, and on rare occasion has grand mal seizures that cause temporary loss of consciousness. This was primarily controlled medically, until a short while ago, when she had a series of seizures while on the water. The final time she has such an episode, she nearly drowned. 

This woman is incredible. She is a journalist, a philanthropist, an environmentalist, and activist for social progress, a lover of animals and people, and just incredibly kind and beautiful in every way. She does more for others than most, and she never sweats it. Her biggest joy is spending time on the water, experiencing the ocean, and I think she deserves to have that. I need to figure out a way to make this happen.

My best idea so far is a very small supply of scuba air or oxygen, worn on a personal floatation device, with a breather mask, and a ""dead man"" thumb switch to activate flow of air in the event that a plunger is let loose. 

Any better ideas, or ways to implement or improve this idea would mean the world to a woman who deserves every joy the world can offer her, and to me, who doesn't deserve her in my life, and want to bridge that gap with my best efforts to be what she deserves. 

Any ideas? 💡",rkpxso

conceptually it is the same as a ""dark  chamber"" or an actual camera, so Ideally it would produce images in a similar way

a problem that might emerge is the size and sensibility of the microphones. but still, even if we are not capable of producing decernable images, just a proof of concept os really cool! like the relative position of the sound source or something...

let me know what you guys think, does something like this already exists? (I would expect so given that this idea is very easy to come up with) and if there is not something like this, it leads me to think that the idea is just stupid...

why i hate him,2,"I don like to do this but im on my last straw. I can't keep it in anymore. My father has ruined my entire life, let me explain. I was once a young kid(not anymore im an adult now) with full of character i was funny, i was well liked and I loved my life up until 8 grade (many years ago) where i got into a huge fight with my ""father"" where he ended up  pulling me up and throwing me on a wall where i got my t shirt ripped I was only 13 at the time but that wasn't the worst part. If it was just that i could've forgiven him however my ""father"" then proceeded to not talk to me for a full year basically was neglected by him not one word. He muted me out. I don't know who does that to their 13 year old son I was still a kid. That obviously ended up destroying me emotionally and mentally. I lost all confidence in myself, I lost my friends, I became socially anxious as i thought i was a good for nothing since even my own father gave up on me, I also became extremely depressed and was suicidal. My chance of having a normal teenage life was done at that point btw all these he caused I am still dealing with them many many years later what also bothers me about is wich kind of parent stops talking to their own little son and how do you not think of the negative mental effects it will have on him. My life became hell at the point. The worst part is that my ""father"" never apologised to me about this as i was pretty much forced after a year to apologise to him. We then started being ""okay"" with each other after that however the damage was already for about 2 years we went on like nothing happened but i wasnt the same still struggling with everything he caused me. I decided to cut him out tho after about 2 years and stop speaking to him due to what he had done years passed. We still live under the same roof tho sadly as i cannot afford a place of my own yet. That's not the only thing that i hate about my ""father"" even though i cannot if he was mentally abusive when i was younger i definitely he would sometimes hit me a bit too much and would scream at me too much. Another thing that cannot ever forgive him for is that he cheated on my mom even though she does everything for him. She cooks, cleans and is borderline his full time servant while he sits and watches tv and gets mad often. So my mom gives her all for him and that loser cheats on her. The only thing he does is he has a hardworking job where he works like 80 hours a week but that doesn't matter as i barely any of the money makes and anyways i want nothing to do with it. He is a good breadwinner tho i can't lie. As of march 2020 i am still dealing with everything my dad caused me mentally my life has been because of him and i've also been suicidal imagine killing myself cause of everything he caused me. Still that the person that is supposed to love me and protect me gave up on me and caused more pain then anyone else in this world. Laslty, i just wanna know if any of you have good tips on how i can deal with this and what is your opinion on this situation. Oh and thank you guys so much for reading this and responding you don't know how much means to me :)",fxddak

People leave me and I don't know why.,3,"It's a long one. Sorry for any typos. 

Okay, so here's my problem. All my life, friends would just leave me, with no explanation. 

One friend I had for 5 years, and who was a part of the family, and my mom loved her like a daughter, left me to hang out with a new girl who dated her brother at the time. I messaged her yesterday (about five years after we stopped hanging out) and told her everything that still bothered me after all those years, and she said it was all my fault and that I must be on drugs to write that stuff to her. I didn't reply to that because she does not deserve it. But she did leave. 

One girl, I really clicked with a year ago, (she is my boyfriend's sister's childhood friend) just stopped texting me or going out for coffee. I have no idea why. Maybe I should ask her, but I'm nervous about it. I don't want hee to assume that I'm clingy or something. 

One girl, for whom I thought was literary my soulmate, changed her attitude when I got a boyfriend. When we started hanging out, I didn't have a boyfriend, neither did she, and we spent every moment together. About 2 years after hanging out, I met my boyfriend. She was happy, she liked him. About 3 months into our relationship, when she realized we were serious, she changed her attitude. I realized something was wrong, but I didn't want to jump to any conclusions. Then I got a job in a city where he lived too, and it all changed. I called her every day after work, and she wouldn' t ask me how I was, how he was, she would just talk about herself. Then we had a huge fight where she said that we're both retarded and deserve each other, that our relationship sucks. We didn't speak for a month and kinda patched it up. Now we talk every 2-3 months, sometimes not even then. I miss her, but whenever I think about what she said to me and how I felt it makes me sick. 

I can't say that I didn't fuck up some of the other friendships I had, because I can't stand when people sneak behind my back or if they patronize me. I'm not perfect and I don't act like I am, but I believe that I didn't hurt nobody, at least not intentionally. 

I don't know what is it about me that makes people leave. Do you think there's something wrong with me?",fwi9uo

Father issues,3,"Hi I’m Henry and I’m 14, I’ll turn 15 later this month.
I get a pretty good amount of support from my friends and family and that’s wonderful. I really love everyone around me. 

Other than the other house I have to go to, my father is on surface level disrespectful to me, and is major subscribed to diet racism/misogyny. But when he and my mom were together he was mentally abusive and manipulative.

In recent years I’ve shown him I don’t like him and I’m cold with him, showing no interest and spending no extra time than I must with him.
But this past year I’ve developed what seems to be father issues. I’ve gotten attached to one of my male teachers, a simple compliment from him means the world to me. He’s the closest thing to a father I have in my life.

I don’t know how to get over this or fix this, I have this craving to just have some deep voiced man say I’m proud of you son.",fuqejk
Scammed out of money for a nintendo switch TWICE!,5,"I recently tried to buy a Nintendo switch of someone on Depop, this was through PayPal family and friends  and then I never received the switch and the person deleted the account which I later found out was hacked hence the hacker taking my money and deleting the account. 
I then tried to buy one off someone else on vinted. 
Vinted are a bit different where the money isn't released to the seller until I say that the item has been delivered.
This person wouldn't send unless they had the money so being as gullible as I am I released the money to them before they sent it, they have now also deleted their account and I have no proof of postage from either. 
It's pretty obvious I've been scammed and both PayPal and vinted say I can't get my money back. 

I'm with nationwide and I have submitted 2 visa disputes to them. 

I have argued profusely with both PayPal and vinted to get my money back and they said there's nothing I can do. 

Basically I'm asking if theres any likelihood I'll get my money back from the bank? 

I had no buyer protection with PayPal as it was family and friends bit vinted said my buyer protection was no longer valid because I released the money before getting the item. 

I'm out £260 ( basically enough to buy a brans new switch)  and I don't need any criticism from anyone as I already know how much of an idiot I've been to fall for this twice. 
I'm asking for advice and help.",ftvd6g
Should I be mad about my little sister getting things without trying while I have to work my butt off for things?,2,"sorry for bad grammar and spelling just wanted to rant about this problem I had that came out around an hour ago
Recently since the new ACNH switch came out I've been begging my parents to get me one and recently my little sister (8years old) suddenly wants it. I kept telling my parents a bunch of reasons why she shouldnt get it for example she broke her charger for her ipad around 4-5+ times last year and also had a replace/fix her ipad a couple times during that same year. I also told my parents I'd they do get her one they would be wasting $300 escpially if I'm correct you cant get warranty and you would have to buy another switch to replace.
So the real problem starts about an hour ago tonight. My sister and my grandma(I have a bad relationship with) talked about the ACNH switch and said to her she'll buy her one with her money tomorrow and told my dad. Over course being in the same room as mu dad I overheard their conversation and got really pissed about it. Since all my sister had todo was tell my grandma to buy her one. While I beg for my parents to try and get me one. What sucks even more is that all my devices like my laptop, games, and a switch(I wanted another one because I am a big fan of the game and the design)  I earned all of those with getting good grades and honor rolls. So I told my dad it was unfair and he said, "" it's your grandma's money and you should be happy for your sister"" And of course I'm pissed cause ik my grandma hates me and I hate her (more into that another time) and my grandma adores my sister.
A week before  I tried to give my sister my old 3ds and a few minutes later to get changed she fricking put my 3ds back on the table and told me it was ugly and wanted the switch. I got pissed because I gave her that 3ds so she could learn if she actually wants the switch or not because I have and also for just 1 game. 
Then yesterday she told my dad when he came home she didnt want the switch then I'm there all happy because I get a chance. Back to present day all the fucking sudden she wants it now.

Is wrong for me to get mad her and should I be happy for her instead?",fsxpxl

"Humans were God's mistake, that's why he created religion and prayer.",1,"I am an Agnostic Theist, just wanted to get that out of the way. And I'll be using He so I don't have to keep saying God. And when I say ""intelligent beings"" I mean living things that are smart enough to contemplate their own existence.

What if there is a God and He decided to create the universe, the laws of science and math, and the ingredients to make life so He could peacefully observe the universe without having to interact. Like what if He created all the laws of science and math and just made the big bang and stopped there to ""sit back and enjoy the show."" And everything after the big bang was just spontaneous ""entertainment"" to Him based on the laws He made? 

But when making the laws and the ingredients for life, He never intended to make life smart enough to contemplate its own existence. But He made a mistake and because of the laws and ingredients He designed and made, humans came to be as a product of evolution, a concept He designed.

Instead of stopping evolution and rewriting the laws He wrote, he decided to write new laws that made an afterlife and made a system or systems to help intelligent life. These systems could be interpreted as Karma and some grand system that interprets prayer and based on Karma and other factors, answered those prayers subtley so God didn't have to interfere anymore. 

He could just lay back again and watch even more. And the reason He didn't rewrite humans and intelligent life out of existence, was because He thought it would make this show we call the universe more interesting.

And since we don't know whether we are the first intelligent beings in the universe, what if this happened first with the first ever intelligent beings on a far away planet, beings that we would consider aliens, and those new laws were in place long before the existence of humans.",rks3go

some sort of place to catalogue internet weirdos,1,"i cannot explain why , but it is very entertaining for me to watch some random youtuber investigating the internet activites of these people , idk i guess its like watching a crime documentary , but the problem is : its kinda difficult to intentionally find these videos , you cant just search ""internet weirdos"" on youtube and get a satisfying result , you can search the name of the person in question , but you would need to know it first , wich is not the case most of the times for me , so the idea that i suggest is : some kind of place where people can catalogue and discover these curious internet dwellers more easily. in this moment , the only thing that i can think about where this idea would work is a wiki page , but people in the comments might know about other places where the idea could be applied to.

"Today is Farch 1st. Happy Farch, everyone!",62,"The Farch Calendar

• All months are 30 days.

• Weeks are 6 days (bye, Tuesday).

• All 30-day months break evenly into 5 weeks.

• A year is 60 weeks.

• 60 weeks of 6 days = 12 months of 30 days = 360 days. The leftover days at the end of the year go into an extra mini-month called Farch.

• Our schedules are simpler to split up and our time is easier to manage. Weeks of the year can be divided like minutes of the hour; great for schools, team projects, salaries.

• Farch is 5 days long. The extra day in a leap year gets tacked onto every fourth Farch, making a leap Farch 6 days long.

• No one works on Farch, if they can avoid it. It’s time outside the normal year to slow down and do nothing.

• With months dividing evenly into weeks, every month starts on Sunday and ends on Saturday.

• Not Farch, though. Farch is all Saturdays.

• By keeping the months in sync with weekdays, floating holidays become locked to dates. For example, on the Farch calendar, Thanksgiving always falls on November 22nd. US Election Day is always November 3rd.

• The year ends on the solstice; December 21st on our calendar, which becomes the last day of Farch, so the days stop getting shorter on New Year’s Eve and start getting longer on January 1st.

• And while we’re at it, no more back and forth with Daylight Saving. Same time year-round.

• This system was used by the Egyptians 6000 years ago. They called their 5-day intercalary month “The Five Upon the Year,” which, when written in hieroglyphs, looks kinda like Farch.",rimtef

"A fully submersible, deep soaking bathtub or hot tub with a breathing tube.",3,"Think back to the cliché in science-fiction where characters are imprisoned, healed, or put in stasis in those glass tubes filled with goop or some other liquid. It’s meant to invoke an eerie or unsettled feeling in the audience, but sometimes when I see them, I think, “that would be a neat idea for a spa, where you can safely cocoon yourself in a personal blissful hot tub.

The first thing to consider for this is obviously, “how are you supposed to breath?” So you would of course use a snorkel that would be preferably connected to an opening on top of the tank, meaning you’re not fully encased and can come come up for more air if you need to, or climb out. The bath should also be small enough for a single person, but spacious enough so that you don’t get claustrophobic. It also doesn’t have to be see-through, so you can have some privacy if you choose to forgo a swimsuit, but there can at least be a window (maybe with a slider you can open and close). Also some lights inside to keep thing lit—ones that glow warm colors to make things serene. And some spa jets. They can even be in-ground instead of large standing stalls or tanks. Oh, and the water doesn’t have to be piping hot, but warm enough to be relaxing.

I kept Googling this concept but couldn’t find anything just like it.

Bee food!!,2,"Have you ever noticed during high pollen days, the pollen likes to stick to the surface of your car, lawn furniture, basically any metal surface in your yard. How about we create a metal disk that has a wide surface area and keep it in high floral areas. We collect the pollen residue each day (of course this would have to be seasonally made) than synthesize it into a nectar or fine powder. It can be preserved yearly and depending on if a nectar or powder can be given in a fake flower applicator or in a serum into a bee hive directly so the bees can consume and create more honey from the supplement and thus create a bigger output for farmers or more food for wild bees. Sometimes in the winter bees are active but not many flowers are around. This can help nourish those bees and hopefully keep the population up. Through genetic modification, after some study time and science application, antibiotics or vitamins and minerals than can aid in the bees and there hive can be put into the ‘bee food’, or pollen reserves. This of course would affect the honey made but it would be interesting to see what can happen. Maybe it’ll make a harmless honey that can literally aid an asthmatic with resistance to pollen allergies?

Time stamp app,5,"I went to the gym the other day and when I left I forgot exactly what time I arrived. So I thought it would be nice to have this app where I could check in on a location with a time stamp. And when I leave, I can check out. It’s a start but it could develop more into something bigger. Like for example, an algorithm that recognises the same place you’ve visited and detects if you leave the radius of a specific location. The idea seems a bit flat maybe, but I would like to keep track of where I go and how much time I’ve spent in different places.

I personally spend a lot of time digging through my ever increasing mailbox for some of the content I subscribed to. 

My solution would be 
- a minimalist mobile interface to read bite-sized content from your favorite content-creators(writers). 
- Sign up to receive a newsletter or article with a username as opposed to your email address.
- In app settings would allow you to control when you want to get notified about new or old materials from your faves.
- Creators can publish bite-sized content to subscribers via the platform without cluttering their emails

Local Sports App (Find me a Court),5,"Hey,

The basic problem that this app would solve is that from my personal experience when I used to go play basketball in the local courts near my area, there would be a problem with the player population that day on the court.

I would usually have no idea how many people would show up and how many would have a basketball with them. Now I did have the phone number of a couple of people and I would just text them to ask but there were many other players that I had no idea of. This resulted in times when there were very few players on the court and and you would just waste time and not have much fun or there was no one with a basketball.

On the other hand there was a opposite problem experienced. I went to a court all ready to play and was welcomed with over 30 people trying to play on the same court. Now again in this case you barely got to play and it was a waste of time in the end.

There seemed to be a mismatch in the court many times, for example after playing just a boring 2 v 2 you would find out that the court a few kilometers away had 6 people playing and you could have played full court with them. Or 30 people were jammed in one court while there were 2 other courts that had barely any players there. Only if there was a way players knew which court to go to to enjoy basketball as per their need.

Now here comes an app which lists all basketball courts near you and you can expand the search area if you can travel further easily (up to you). So now you select a court and get to know it's details like location, court condition and maybe some recent pictures or videos of the court. Next you have the option to select that you are going to play at that court and at what time. Your entry will be recorded and there can be some visual that shows the players that want to play at that court along with their timings. You can look at the player details which would have the player's basic bio data and to make things more interesting you add your skills, what position you play and your physical attributes. You can mention if you play with a team or club.

Value of the App ? Now any basketball player would have a good idea in which court and at what time how many players are attending and this way the courts can be utilized in a far better way with people going to courts according to their needs.

FYI, I do not play myself anymore as I am busy with my job but I do think of the problem I used to have a teenager and think about an app for that problem. This concept can be further expanded to other sports with similar problems e.g football, hockey and tennis.",r6fqzm

An app to say bye when you die,18,"Hi :) 

First of all, sorry for my english, but I would like that someone roast the next idea and I would like to explain it the best I can.

I'm trying to taking care of my Instagram / Twitter / LinkedIn / Facebook / etc. accounts and every day I'm exposing a part of my life to a lot of people that, in some way, is interested on it. 

I made a lot of friends and contacts online (more than in the real life) and it's OK but... What happens when I die? 

I'm sure that it's going to be very difficult that a big part of ""my audience"" know it and I think that I would like to send a last email with my thoughts about life... or publish a last photo on Instagram... or send a last tweet. Don't know !

And here is the idea. An app where you can store and program the last messages that you want to publish to your social media or the last mails that you want to send. You should invite by email the people that you want to have the power of publish / send your last words, and for be able to press ""the red button"" they should send a death certificate.

What do you think about this idea? I have many ideas around it and I would be very happy to discuss them with someone :)

Dab - Your 3D Avatar Home Phone,1,"I'm at the idea stage but would like to hear your guys input or advice on this idea. You can subscribe at [https://www.producthunt.com/upcoming/dab](https://www.producthunt.com/upcoming/dab)



Introducing the Dab.

Your personal home phone for receiving and making calls with 3D Avatars. You will be able to download the Dab app to set up your device, create your 3D Avatar, receive a Dab Number to receive calls, and add friends and family.

You can put the Dab device on your work office desk, at home in the kitchen, living room, or even Bedroom. The Dab device can be your home phone and can be a fun and exciting way to communicate with friends and family without using your cell phone or computer. Imagine how many people would love to answer your phone call so they can see your Avatar :)

You will be able to control your avatar's facial expression with the app and you can send gestures and animations while in the call.

Voice Assistant

Danny will be your calling assistant.

You will be able to say commands like ""Hi Danny, call Mike"" and Danny will call Mike.

Connecting Multiple Devices

You will be able to connect to different Dab devices in your home or you can use the Dab app instead of the device. The Dab device that is closes to your phone will ring. Also, say if you are having a conversation on the Dab device in the living room but need to go in the kitchen. Your Dab device in the kitchen will automatically come on (If your phone is near it) without ending the call so you can stay connected with your friends or family no matter where you are in your home.

I would love to use something like this for my home and I wouldn't be upset if no one else buys it or if someone takes the idea. It's all about execution. I have a few friends who are 3D Artist, Mechanical/Electrical Engineers and I can get the app MVP developed.

Would you use this for your home?

I know that you can use AR Memoji's and Filters on apps but thought it would be great to have your own home device just for receiving or making calls with your customize 3D Avatar. If I do pursue this idea and if everyone wants to use it then I can come out with other features for it. Like, users can create their own voicemail with an animation or Dab For Businesses where you can have a second account with professional attire for receiving incoming calls from businesses and the businesses will have their own AI and work avatars.

Like Yelp but just for tattoo shops?,6,"My tattoo artist and I were talking recently about the insane amount of unprofessional tattoo artists there are in our area. I'm talking well-known creeps who send lewd pictures to women, artists who trash talk clients while other clients are around, artists who make people remove certain clothing items when it is totally unnecessary but the client may not know that in the moment. So I just thought it would be really cool for someone to make an app that is like Yelp but solely for tattoo shop reviews. Maybe with a likert scale for how comfortable the artist made you feel, how well they prepped, how clean the place is, if they were heavy-handed, and info about their aftercare process and what they offer. Maybe anonymous and non-anonymous options, and a picture upload feature. I think there should be a way to warn others about potentially dangerous or inappropriate situations that could be avoided by going to a higher-rated shop. It's definitely something I myself would love to use.",qw0b8k

I'm writing a book. to skip to the relevant part, i'm trying to write about a hypothetical extreme cold weather suit that is hooked up with a jerry-rigged heating system. Pretty much made from scrap (Think Fallout) Basically the premise so far is I have a respirator system (think SCUBA) linked up to a powered heater that heats intake air for respiration and does not permit cold air into the system. It achieves this through a series of heating elements wired to a bunch of laptop batteries. During the day, solar panels charge the batteries. The suit (in writing) can last 3 hours on a full charge. Its supposed to be cycled on/off to recharge while letting the suits insulation hold the heat in the meantime.

I am not an electrician. I know this is cracked out.

Looking for new application fields,0," 

Dear community!

I am looking for an application field for a new foil. Imagine you had a foil that can do the following: The whole foil can conduct electricity and seperatly transfer information. You could for example integrate LEDs and control them individually, so you can use it for lighning or even make a display out of it. Another possibility would be to use it as an alarm system, due to many sensors that need electricity as well as information. In addition, there would be a possibility of power plugs, that could be placed anywhere on the foil. Furthermore, the foil could be adapted to individual needs, it is flexible and could be cut in any form and size. The individual elements could be applied as desired. You could also use it outside, due to the fact that it is very robust.

Do you have ideas or suggestions, where the foil could find use? Have you ever been in a situation where this foil would have helped you?",qxi2kd

A tamper proof app that can turn a smartphone into a simple text and call phone.,4,"Technology has moved towards smartphones but unfortunately gave up on dumbphones. For conscious parents who want to at least give their kid an old phone to call when needed, but not get distracted with it or all the other shenanigans that come with a smartphone at the hands of a child, it would be cool to have an app that can turn such phones into simple text and call phones without a way to disable the app. Right now there are some apps attempting to do such thing (for example the freedom app) but can be easily disabled if someone knows which setting to change. It's probably a manufacturer design choice to not allow any lock attempt for system settings, but maybe that could be changed.",qsdsz9

Military and Luxury Planes that turn into Different Sized Hangers.,1,"\Hangar 😭

The fuselage separates and the long halves spread apart along a track underneath the wing becoming the wall of the hangar. This can even be done rudimentarily with a fuselage that fits together with large jigsaw puzzle-like teeth tightly bound together forming a seam running along its length at the bottom and a locking rod stuck through the seam of teeth that connects the fuselage.

The rudimentary idea for this is very practical for a minimalistic design. The halves of the fuselage open and run along the track towards the tip of the wings forming a low hangar, which has a prehistoric rock home aesthetic.

This idea has so many applications and tweaks:

Instead of the fuselage separating, legs can simply extend from the tips of the wings and create more of a tent, without walls.

Barn-sized and Hangar-sized airplanes might require smaller fuselages, but that's not problematic:

Implementing joints into the wings of these crafts would allow the airplanes enhanced turning capabilities by tilting their wings. Seeing a large bird aircraft tilt its wings would look intense especially with loose and fast hinge release mechanism, just like how a loose hinge flops around. This flapping and tilting causes the craft to look futuristic and intimidating! Seeing one of these in the sky would be like something you'd see in a movie, and with freaky lights too, it could be really intimidating!

Having airplanes that serve multiple functions like gunship designs or water craft, these birds have a lot of human charm to them I'd love to see come alive in both military and luxury use.

"Bicycle Parking Kiosk (Reorganized, Pitch-Like)",3,"E-bikes are something that almost everyone kinda wants to use.  But what is the biggest thing keeping people from adopting them?

#THEFT

(Well, insanely homicidal motor vehicle drivers are a close second.)

You know in the USA, and many other countries, bicycle theft is a leading pastime of criminals.  Even though an e-bike can qualify as GRAND THEFT (just as bad as stealing a car) in most states, police will practically never bother with such a crime, making it 'practically legal' to steal and vandalize them.  Heck, many times a few parts are stripped, and the whole thing is thrown into a dumpster.  Or may as well be, due to the destructive methods used to extract 'valuable' parts.

There is ebike insurance, but how often can you collect on insurance, then wait up to months for your replacement bike to be delivered, just to have it stolen again?  So your ebike gets stored away somewhere, unused, where it can't be stolen... but why do you even have it now?

Your options are empty iron loops for you to chain your bike to, or nothing at all but what you can improvise to chain your bike to.  Nobody pays attention to bike thieves at all, even as they use huge bolt cutters and angle grinders in public.

Every second you're away from your chained bike is spent worrying about whether it's being stolen right now.

So, how about a bicycle security kiosk?  Give it a roof to somewhat protect the bikes from the weather, and gives the kiosk secure places to mount things, and with remotely monitored (over the internet) video.  Each bicycle spot has its own built-in electronic lock, with an extra-long cable to secure both wheels and frame, with video instructions on-site for how to do it.  Available in multiple sizes, from 4 to 64 parking spots.  Or just add more kiosks as you go.

Plus where these appear, there are one or more mobile vans that show up to investigate suspicious happenings at these kiosks, do 24 hour maintenance, and on-call bicycle service for minor repairs and transportation to qualified bike shops.  If something goes wrong at a kiosk, summon help.  Those vans exist for a reason.  Our cities are full of little vermin who destroy everything.

A kiosk parking slot can be locked and unlocked with the phone or credit card that you used to lock the bike with.  It will turn on an AC outlet over the slot you parked your ebike at, to charge it while you're away.  Buy a parking slot per use, or from a monthly subscription.  With optional additional levels of insurance on your bike, on top of ""we'll make it work again"" insurance.  Show your bike to the camera before you lock it.  Show your bike to the camera after you unlock it.  Or summon the service van for assistance if damage has occurred.

Every grocery store, strip mall, downtown area, mall, office space, public buildings, beach, park, etc. might have this kiosk, offering per-use security and affordable monthly subscriptions for peace of mind.  The foot traffic from the premium security might even make the regular public bike racks more viable as a place to leave your bicycle for a while.  

With the mobile app, you could get notified of disturbances to your bike in the kiosk, with pictures, AND at the same time the service van will be notified to check up, and possibly the police.  Within a relatively short time, these kiosks will get a reputation of being well guarded, with prompt security/police response.  Since imagery of the kiosks is streamed to people monitoring at home, as their jobs.  It goes 'beep', take a look.  Back to your normal internet addictions.  Something happened?  Dispatch alert to the internal forum about something happening, let the vans know.  Let the police know if it's obviously a crime.  HD video constantly recorded in a loop (similar to dash cams), so time before and after a disturbance is captured.

Better than finding your broken lock on the ground where your cargo bike used to be, with half a cart full of groceries.  

Each kiosk will have a small video screen.  For instructions, showing the QR code for the app, local ads, community maps, etc. and confirming/locking/unlocking slots.  AC power outlets over each spot.  A bicycle hoop and lock assembly, to secure the bicycle.  Cameras pointed in several directions to give an overview of the bikes and area around the bikes.  LED lighting to keep everything well lit.  It may flash or give warnings when it's alerting and recording.  Even if the screen gets broken, people with the app or cards will still be able to interact with the system to unlock their own bikes.

Probably the most key thing in the system are the service vans.  Keep the kiosks shiny, clean and functional.  Above all the appearance of active patrol.  One piece of graffiti on a wall attracts a thousand more.  Vandalism has to be cleaned up quick.  Police need to be referred to violations.  People who try to disturb users' bikes MUST be prosecuted.  Security, minor bike repairs and parts, kiosk troubleshooting and repair.

On the back-end, a VPN for the kiosks to live in, and some internet infrastructure for the people who monitor the video to report activity, and get the messages to the vans.

Lots of ways to sell these to a city council or chamber of commerce or people with some extra space in their parking lots.  They don't need tons of infrastructure.  Their own built-in internect connectivity and power.  Just need a little space, hardly more space than any other bicycle parking.  Provide a lit-up place for bicycles at night.  People on bikes are a bit more likely to make other stops on their trips.  Especially when considering the cost of operating an ebike versus a car, or maneuvering it into strange, new places.  The kiosks giving the public a sense of security to leisurely hang around restaurants and shops and theaters without worrying about their ride.",qnwam8
Bicycle Parking Kiosk,4,"An open stall similar to a bus stop.  Roofed with bicycle rack and  very secure integrated bike locks and cables that are opened electronically with your credit card or any RFID card with a 'chip' in it, that matches what you locked it with.  Plenty of illustrated instructions, a clear map of where you are.  Maybe it's just a video screen for this, so yeah, ads.  Battery backup so if power is interrupted, you can still get your bike, at least.

When you lock the bike, it takes your picture.  When you unlock the bike (electronically), it takes your picture.  Motion sensors detect anyone futzing with the bikes and live-stream it to the nearest police (or city, or management) dispatch to record and display.  24 hour cameras from multiple angles and well lit place to put your bike or e-bike.  Maybe even turn on an outlet with your credit card, to charge your e-bike.

Maybe if you lock with your cell phone (and provided app), it will notify you and email pictures of your bike if anyone disturbs it on the rack.  Also integrate with a map app, so you can find where you parked it again, especially in some unfamiliar downtown.

Possibly a part of a bike rental service, which rented out e-bikes and provided extra stalls for other bikes.  Again, rent it with the app, go through the check out inspection procedure.  Keep track of rejected bikes so someone can come out and fix/replace it.  Return the bike at the stall with the check in inspection procedure, including plugging it back in and posing with the bike (both sides) to show its condition.",qnoeaq

I don't have a voice in my house,4,"My family is complicated to say the least. From an early point in my life my mom did abuse my sisters and I, which really made me a quiet person even to this day. I always feel like I don't have a voice in many situations, and most of the time I don't. If a disagreement happens between my sister and i, I would also get pieced out because I don't make money or have a job. Anyways I got out of that situation with my mom which was extremely taxing on me, and I moved in with my oldest sister, kia, around the age of 15 or 16, I'm 18 now. I can't thank my sister enough for what she has done but it comes with a few problems. My sister restricts so much from me and even my friends can see it too, for example before this corona stuff happened, I've had to babysit almost every week for multiple times a week, for multiple hours until midnight or so. I would get angry at her but not say anything about it because one time she threatened to kick me out of her house, and I have nowhere else to go. She says our family is a team, which I highly dislike because we're more than a team, we're a family. I also dislike this stigma because she treats me like I'm the worse person ever at times and I'm a good student and I'm respectful. She restricts my video game usage, which at first I understood and abided by. But now she's restricting it even more and I have no clue why. I did research on internet usage on games and electricity usage on games as well because it might be a financial thing. When I presented Kia with this information she told me she didn't care. Video games don't take up that many resources when compared to cable boxes or phones and honestly games helps me cope with alot of the mental problems that I have, and helps me actually become happy despite me overthinking, or not being sure of myself. She limited my entire wifi usage for my other sister, Quiana, and I for 4 shared hours. So school work, YouTube, phone usage, and game playing all have to fall between those four hours. I don't understand why she would implement this considering my sister's husband isn't even out of a job considering all of this corona stuff. The only enjoyment I've had so far is playing video games/watching anime for the short time I'm available to. At times like this sure my mom would beat me and whatnot but I wonder if she would limit my passions like Kia does. It really hurts because it's like her way of telling me ""I don't care about how you find your happiness."" The dream I set for myself is to be a gaming YouTuber funny enough, but knowing that my family knows this they just don't care about my passion for editing videos. It's really hard for me to speak up considering I was abused before and Kia dangles that over my head. For college I need a PC which I'm not asking for it here it's just needed for a film college I got accepted into and she expects me to ask my mom for it. I seriously hate my mom for the things she's done to me. Why would I talk to her? Why would I ask her for stuff like nothing's never happened?",fra83u

Parents that I believe are crazy,1,"Hey fellow Redditors, 
I don't know if my parents are exactly crazy but I needed to know so here it is. Btw I'm 17(f) a few months away from my 18th birthday.
Today I went to work in the morning from 7:00 to 14:00 and after that my father decided to be ""nice"" and ""allowed"" me to watch one online lesson today, two tomorrow before noon and one on Sunday, and then he told me that he expected me to go vacuum my room and wash all the bathrooms, sinks, and mirrors in the house before my mom got home. My mom comes home at 4 so I was a bit pressed on time but apparently she didn't mind that I didn't do what I was supposed to at first so my parents went to get groceries and left me at home and I decided to take a little break, when they came back my mom told me that I should continue relaxing and she went to clean the bathroom, sinks and mirrors herself. When I said that I already promised to do it and was going to in like half an hour she sarcastically said that it's fine and I should just ""continue not doing anything useful"" and then she added that ""it's not like you ever do anything useful"" then my grandfather came to the kitchen where I was sitting and yelled at me about how ungrateful I am and how I'm just wasting time and forcing my mom to do my work and that I always act selfishly like that. Then my father chimed in about how this is not the first time I have disregarded their wishes and ignored my chores. I was angry that they were all yelling at me but not really surprised because they do this almost every weekend exept my grandfather usually doesn't add to this conversation. Then I went and finished what was left and when I came back to the kitchen my father again emphasized that I should have done it as soon as I came back from work and how I should have known better than to delay it since I apparently do nothing useful all day.

Backstory : I have been in many different relationships. I had girlfriends and i had boyfriends, yet i have never been as happy as with this one person. I met him few months ago and we instantly fell in love with each other. We saw it in each others' eyes. It was that shine and that emotion no words could have explained. Then came our relationship. We started off really quickly. We were very atracted to each other and we shared many emotions. We felt comfortable together. So comfortable that he was the first person i ever fully opened sexually to.
After few months of heaven i started to notice that he wasn't feeling as good as i did. We talked many nights and settled that he is afraid of geting into a serious relationship. 
I agreed on not calling it a relationship then, and not calling each others boyfriends. Next few weeks passed calmly but then the tough times came... Coronavirus has appeared and we got seperated by 350 miles. It wasn't the distance that concerned me.
The day he arrived home we talked on the phone, he sounded much happier than with me.
I asked him what he felt like - he said he felt free. 
He was feeling bad with commitment and got scared because of me stepping into his daily life.
Tonight we broke up.

I really love him. He loves me too.

I can't be in opened relationship which is his proposition. I am a romantic, emotional and delicate guy.

I don't know what to do or what to feel like. I would love to try being in this relation with him, because i am afraid of loosing him and yet again being alone. At the same time i am scared of being hurt because of this kind of relation.

I am sick of this shit,3,"My mom and I since I gone to High school we are arguing for stupid reasons. I'll tell you sth that really hurt my heart last night. So my mom was suggesting me to go for a ride with her car. Because I am very scared of Corona virus I politely refused. Then I got shocked. She threatened to punch me and she called me a loser. When she left I burst into tears. Thank god my grandparents were on my side. I was a lot better afterwards. 

The question is how can I respond if this happens many times?",fkxppb
My friend freaks out about the coronavirus😫,3,"It basically took over our everyday convo. I cannot change the subject with her , I can try to talk about Netflix , no I'm being too irresponsible and she switches to virus. 

I share my news about my university plans , she says "" if I were you I wouldn't have my hopes up in case they don't open borders and you stuck here "" for context; I got the call from uni and they really wanted to meet me and asked if I'm interested. I liked their course and how close it is so I applied for uni abroad which is like 2 hours by car ( yes I live close to border ) and it just sucks to hear that she just shoots down a thing that made me happy and hopeful. 


I tried to talk to her, calm her down but she dosent listen. She watched so many news and is terrified she locked herself in her house and sends her parents to do her shopping ( she is 22 ). I told her she should take necessary precautions but not to panic cause it won't do shit but everytime I share my opinion she just says I am not careful enough. 
It drives me nuts. Any advice? I asked her if she has some issues with me moving abroad even if it is still 2 hours by car from her. She has driving license but is too scared to drive. 


Sorry for the rant but I need an opinion from someone. 
Thank you and have a nice day/evening 🌺",fjup7n
Well imma head out,2,"Gonna take a break from reddit ever since I started I’ve been going down hill physically, mentally, socially, in terms of school work. Haven’t even been using it nearly as much as YouTube. But at my old school I could work like crazy all day i was a complete workaholic. At this new school the low IQ spreads everywhere and now i can’t do anything. Probably the fact that my family is now falling apart isn’t helping. And this corona virus stuff about schools maybe closing and taking time from summer and all of my previous friends that are so epic but I can’t keep up and keep doing stuff with them because 1 i for some Reason feel like it’s really hard work having like more than 3 friends at once I just don’t get why it should be fine they are all amazing,it’s just my families apartment is tiny so I always go to theirs which doesn’t help cuz then that limits a lot. I just don’t know anymore. I want to work nonstop but I can’t with all these changes and stress. Somehow I’m not depressed but I do feel like I’m getting anxiety more,m now.

Another guy (M19) from school expressed his love for me, he's in the year above me. Told his entire class how in love he is with me and how amazing i am. Went out with him to a concert once, as friends. Then i couldnt get back due to the public transport, and i slept over at his place. He then told his whole class that we slept together but we didnt?! I had to turn him down 12 times..
Now after a month of silence he texted me again so i blocked him and hopefully he'll ignore me at school. Oh also my teachers got wind of that and my health counselor made me have a chat with her because of my behaviour around boys?! 
And that i wont be allowed on certain trips and projects if i didnt stop acting like i did. Mind you i didnt do anything that dude told his class a bunch of whack things and now its my fault?

Okay so i'm good friends with two brothers.
One is M20 and the other is M23, i do scouting with both of them and often after were done in the evening we go to their house for a drink.
Now with M23 we go to movies, sail a lot, just generally hang out etc. We're good friends. Now about a year and a half ago i asked him if he was into me because he was giving me vague signs. And at that point i wasnt into him or anything but i just needed to know. Now this week he came back from a trip to America for uni and we went to the movies and finally saw each other a lot again and he started to give 'the signs'. The classic putting his arm around me, pulling me in close, cuddling, annoying me by poking me in my side or booping my nose. But only when were alone.
Now outside of being the brother of one of my friends, hes a good friend of my ex. :'( 
Now i dont want to ask him AGAIN if hes into me?!

Also for all of you guys' clarity, i dont have an age gap issue, hence some of the guys mentioned are very much older than me. Also i live in Europe and the age of consent is 16.

Also also, i'm currently doing an audio engineer study so its me and 20 other boys. Doesn't make life easier.

how my whole school goes against me,3,"so this is how it begins.

im currently grade 7 but this happened when i was grade 5. this guy, im gonna call him Luke. we always played soccer with other people in my class and every time i have the ball most of the time (as usual) someone would chase you to get the ball and every time he come for me, he always pushes me and after he done that a few times i kindly told him to stop. he kept on pushing me so i was yelling at him, i even told the teacher once and she/he (i dont remember) told Luke to stop, and he said he would stop but guess what.

he didn't.

i even went to the teacher's office to talk about it and she was talking like it meant nothing

and he continued

because this was my first problem with another student that physically touch me. i told my mom and it kind of went like this (since im to lazy to just tell it in details.):

Mom: yes OP?

me: Mom Luke kept on pushing me at school

Mom: srsly?? push him or punch him if he pushes you again

(mind you i've never hit someone ever since i was in school)

Me: okay..

he pushed me again and the one time i punch him he falls down crying and in my class Luke said he could beat me in a fight soo easily, almost my whole class heard and kept on telling me ""YOU!!?? OUT OF ALL PEOPLE YOU CAN BEAT HIM??? DONT MAKE ME LAUGH""

so yeah as soon as i punch him i go to the office and when i do i got to the principle's office. she looks at me with some sort of death glare and when i told her she told ME i had to go to stay in the office why me???

i still get mad about it today so yeah..

this is my first post so i might not be that good",fflrzv

Girls make no sense: Case example,2,"I'm a sophomore in high school and recently and because I'm not a loser I talk to girls, sometimes, it's not a challenge. However something terrible happened. In my math class, I was seated with 3 other girls in a table group of 4. 

I've sat with them for about 6 months now and every day my confusion and deep annoyance only grows. Initially I thought ""Hell yeah 3 girls this is pretty sweet."" However I was very wrong, it was not sweet at all. 

I had always heard of guys saying how troublesome and confusing girls where and how they couldn't understand their interests and stuff, but I always thought It was just the ""guy"" thing to do and you just kinda had to say you didn't get girls because you where a guy. Turns out I was wrong, kinda.

So we hit it off and our table group develops a friendly group dynamic. So we can be cordial but most the time we are harmlessly being mean to each other just because. However then things began getting weird. These females could just start talking about the boys they like and their relationships and what who said to whoever and other mind-bendingly boring stuff. They could talk for like 40 minutes about just garbage. I realized they where the exception because other girls don't ONLY talk about or as involved in melodrama as these girls do. 

Eventually the teacher kind of gave up on telling them to be quite and only does when she needs to address the class or lecture. Math comes very easily to me and the class goes slow because we have a stupid class, and also they're juniors who managed to fail the class and are repeating. The stupidest people get to set the pace for the whole class unfortunately. So besides studying the girls, I've done other productive things like learn more code, learn more spanish outside of spanish class, etc. 

Anyway that's kinda the context. So the females, they're like a whole other species, they have very different interests, senses of humor, etc. They say things that are totally not funny and laugh about it. I  know it works both ways but I just cannot understand them. 

Now to get specific. I'll start with the best girl. Daniella, she's a transfer student from Spain, she stayed for about 4 months until she had to unfortunately leave, she was smart and nice and her problems which where very similar to the other 2 girls problems where actually interesting. She was mad rich, she had a legit silver rolex and went to a private school. She only came here to learn english and get grounded.  Anyway she's gone but she was great, and it was really cool to hear about the lifestyle she lived.

Anyway the next caste

Ember, Katy, and Ashley

Ember and Katy are both your normal gossipy blonde bitchy girls. Both just talk about boys and makeup and cliche girl stuff. 

Ashley was Daniella's replacement. I was very unsure about her, I was sad to see Daniella get replaced the day after she left. But it turned out Ashley was actually not so bad. She was similar to the other two in that she also was gossipy but she was emotionally and socially smarter. She was also very introspective. Weirdly, she extremely bad at math, even though I considered her the smartest of the girls. 

Anyway Ember made probably the least sense. She had this hearing aid she always wore. I kept telling her it's dangerous because now the government has complete control over one of her senses, and what If someone hacked into it? She would also wear these massive hoop earrings. I hated them. Anytime she wore them I would tell her how goofy they where and how they made no sense. I could fit my head through them. And for her own safety they need to be removed. She never listens to my advice though, I kept on telling her how if she gets near a powerful magnet they are going to tear her ear. 

Ember has been my main concern. She's the most hopeless. Katy is the most bitchy and puts on the ""tough delinquent girl"" act the strongest. But she is the most academic of the girls. She's not terrible if you get to know her.

Ember however is very stupid. One day, she decided to unlearn the rules of basic math. All of a sudden, she didn't understand how negatives worked. She thought a negative minus a negative would result in a more negative number, which it doesn't. However she somehow reached this understanding and had such extreme confidence in it that it was impossible to change her mind without getting the teacher behind me. 

That's when I realized I had to help her with tough love. I so began calling her stupid every chance I got. My hope was she would realize that she is, in fact, stupid. This way at least when she says something stupid, she won't do it with such confidence. Or maybe, after she realizes she's stupid, she will gain the ability to think about the things she says, and hopefully think something like ""oh wait, I need to remember how dumb I am, maybe I should reconsider if what I'm saying is right or if I should say it at all?"" 

Unfortunately I got tired of my efforts going unappreciated, so I stopped. They were also being very mean to me in response, even after I explained my motivations.

App to monitor progress in Notification Centre/Control Centre,0,"Watching Windows update installation progress, file transfers and other similar things got me thinking of an app where you can choose a section of the screen to monitor and it becomes less intrusive to monitor.

Some examples of what I'm thinking about:

 A screenshot crosshair like method of choosing the area to monitor
 A choice of how to monitor the progress, eg. Notification area on Windows/Control Centre for Mac or picture in picture
 If it's a percentage an even smaller version could go to the taskbar or menu bar
 The window could then be closed/minimised to be less annoying



This could work similar to the Parallels Picture in Picture mode, but is only on a certain section of the screen

App idea: Hybrid chat mobile app,2,"I know mobile chat application is a crowded and dominated space by applications such as Messanger, Wechat, WhatsApp, Viber ect..

App concept:

However, the app would be a hybrid chat mobile app where there would be a regular WhatsApp-like text message UI and also a virtual chatroom similar to what can be found in video games. The user can either use memoji (android/iPhone own emojis) for their virtual character face or select an in house default one (cartoon like). Since it may hard to read conversations from the virtual chat (small text bubbles with the option of expanding them) with large groups, the user would have the possibility to split the screen in half with virtual chat room at the top and regular text message UI at the bottom.

To make the conversation a little more interactive, user would have the option to choose a status (online, away, traveling, sleeping etc..) to let others know and depending on the status selected the avatar would change. For example, if you choose sleeping status your avatar would display as sleeping and so on. In future versions, the user will eventually be able to select among many different type of built-in (cartoon like) virtual backgrounds.

To monetize the app advertising would be used but in order to not disrupt users it would be displayed either on the avatar or in the background. For example: if the ad is for a clothing company, its logo would automatically display on the avatars (for the duration of the contract), if it’s a coffee company the log could either display in the background of the virtual chat room or on one of the props or make avatars hold a cup of coffee with logo on it.

What are your thoughts? Would it be something you would use? Feel free to shoot any additional features or any app name ideas!

App for finding other digital nomads and share costs,1,"Nowadays it's not hard to find a job that you can work from home or anywhere in the world. I actually work as a software engineer and traveling across Brazil. The fact is: it's not very cheap to pay it all for yourself: airbnb, food, tours and of course, it's much more fun when there are more people with you.

And for example, when you have to get airbnb and you are alone, you are probably going to get something not very good because the better options are more expensive. This is what i am going through right now. I wish i could get a more sophisticated apartment, closer to the beach, with pool, and other fancy stuff, but the thing is: i don't have anyone to share the bills.

So the idea that i am proposing is, and i don't know if people are going to use it: An app or website to bring these people together, so that they can afford a bigger house, or to contract cleaning services, maybe rent a mansion with other 10 people (each having their own room), i don't know. Since the ""shareable econony"" is a famous term i think i can use it here.

Resuming what i am facing is: i wish i could rent a big mansion, with game room, feel like i am rich and share it with other people.

Would you guys use it? What is your opinion?",qu3k9p
People App,5,"Problem:

 Nowadays we don't see all of the important people in our lives; friends, family and co workers. I used Facebook to see if any important events happened to them but its filled with ads and random posts.
 When we meet new people we don't see everyday it's hard to recall the last conversations. But if you do it shows that you care.

Solution:

 you have a timeline of important events that happened in your life: married, got a dog, bought a house, etc. you can share your timeline with people you trust. Data is never shared outside of your circle.
 Keep track of the last time you talked to them. add notes like 'Adam loves skiing' or 'Josh just went through a tough surgery'.

Non-Variable Scale-able green/clean energy invention,4,"Hello, I need some help/advice

(I just want to be clear I am NOT asking for any money)I have a friend who has this invention that is in patent pending status, this is something that will change the world. I am not a scientist or smart enough to know how it works, or to describe it in details, all I am trying to do for him is find someone who is interested in this idea. We have been trying to contact Elon Musk about it but that is impossible, also contacting several green energy companies who never get back to us. He's an older guy who doesn't even know what reddit is, so I figured maybe we will have some luck on here which is why I am here posting this and he is not.

It's a Non-Variable Scale-able green/clean energy invention which is what he told me to tell people. It does not need to be plugged into an outlet, or need to run on any gas or fossil fuels, with 3 of them hooked up together it can generate 11.8 volts, he is working with an electrician to get it up to 12 volts.I need help/advice in trying to get this invention some attention and have people look at it because once they do it will blow their mind so if anyone can help out or is interested please let me know.It may sound impossible/ridiculous that he created something that works and does this, but it has been done, it is truly amazing and we need help to find people who are seriously interested in this.I'm going to try and see if he can figure out how to make an account on here and can be apart of this, and actually able to talk about it and contact others.

Wrong place,2,"Well, sorry if that post is long. I got nobody to talk about this and I don't speak english well so I'll try my best since I'm belgian.

Everything begun when I was 4 years old, my dad work in the navy and was often at the other side of the world for his job. My mother work in a restaurant company that have a lot of restaurant in my country so we didn't had a lack of money to live, my sister and I had a lot of present every weeks so we played a lot together. I loved my sister a lot as her big brother and I even learned her to walk (she's two years younger than me).
But everything wasn't always pink, my sister and I are different from other people since we've the Asperger's syndrome (a form of autism). That make that we've a lot of difficulty to understand the other humans and can learn very fast when we want to, our dad has the same thing than us and he knew that we were like him when we were young. So he bring us by people who are specialised with child like us to know how to manage us but our mother weren't okay with that because she wanted that we had a ""normal"" and happy life. My sister and I were diagnosed with the Asperger's syndrome and so we passed some test to know at wich point it was.

Me at 4 years old I had an IQ of 130, my sister at 2 years old 140. She already could speak and do math and had a complete photographic memory. 

Our parents discussed about these results, our dad was very happy and wanted to put us in an specialised school but our mother was a bit horryfied at the tought that we would only study without experimenting a normal life. So our dad put my sister and I in an school with other child of our age but with an experimental program that learned us an foreign language very young. At the age of 5 we had a test to enter the next phase of the program and my father sing me in without my mother knowing it. 

When they got the letter saying that I wasn't accepted because of my hyperactivity even if I had the best scotes my dad phoned to the director of the program and said that the exam wasn't staying an hour on a chair but it was answering questions in different topics in an foreign language. After a few minuts discussing I was accepted. My mother couldn't stand that our dad was putting us in an experimental program like laboratory mices so they divorced but my sister and I entered the program.

I entered in elementary school, all my lessons were in Dutch except the French lesson. The other child in my class were all ""normal"", they weren't ""special"" like me so they learned slowly compared to me and when you're so young you're an alien for the others. 
If you wanted something you had to ask it in dutch even if we hadn't learned the vocabulary yet and the program was tough so we had pretty none vocabulary the first 3 years. And it so that an accident that began the real nightmare happened. I needed to go to toilet but i forgot how to say it, I was 6 years old, hypercative so I wasn't listening a lot in class and the teacher was very strict with me because she knew how I was.
Two hours later, i remembered how to say it. I stood up and walked to the teacher but in the middle of the class it was too much and I pee on myself. Everybody was laughing about me and saying that the alien leaked in the middle of the class. The next day the whole school knew it and at the midtime pause during the lunch some people 5 years above me made me dink pee making me believe that it was apple juice.
It was so that I started being bullied because I'm ""different"". In the beginning I tought that it was only little jokes that was normal between peoples (I knew nothing about social and it was really hard to me to understand, even now I'll turn 20 this summer and I have struggles to communicate).
I lived one week with my mother and the other week with my father, they hated each other and my sister and I, we needed to handle it (insults, manipulation,...). My sister weren't aware of what it was because I protected her as much as possible. She was my little world of purity and cuteness. Always smiling, fragile and pure. A lovely little sister with blue/grey eyes and blond hairs. 
Since she was victim of a rape... I failed.. I couldn't protect her, my dad was on a boat far away and my mother weren't home.. 
Since this day she lost her smile a bit more everyday, her eyes became like mine, completely grey and her hairs became more brown.
She isolated her, played less and less with me. Keeping the secret of her rape during years.
Since that happen I became more and more aware of the world around me, how people (even adults) treated me like an alien or a genius. I learned that well when I had an accident and needed a surgery that was 8 hours long or I couldn't walk anymore. Gracefully this accident also happened when my dad was in mission so the army paid the best surgeons to opperate me  because they were responsible for my security when my dad was in mission.
The years passed and the situation got worse. My dad and mother became alcoholic because my sister talked about her rape. My dad couldn't find a stable relationship and so living with him became like managing a child when you're 8.
I got bullied from my 6 years old to my 15 years old. I couldn't get out of the experimental program since I was too precious with my results so I was forced to stay with my bullyers until the end of my scholarship.
I became depressed at 9, went to the psychologist for 4 years but nothing worked and I made 2 psychologist depressed so nobody wanted to listen to me since I was a ""special case of young child with the maturity of an old man"". Some people even said of me that it was like I made the world war when I talked. 

My dad said me horrible things, that I was responsible of all his problems. That my behavior bringed all the problems that destroyed him. My mother was more gentle with me and managed everything so that I could have a better life, enjoying a bit my child life. For that I'm going to thank her forever.
But that didn't last long.
When I was 10 my dad met a women that had 4 girls. I lived a constant nightmare during 5 years. It was so hard to live that I tried twice to kill myself bit the both times I stopped right before I died because I tought that I must stay alive for my mom and my sister. I forced my sister to live exclusively by my mom and managed to make a trial against my father to live by my mom except for 2 weekends a month and the half of the holydays. 
Between my 15 and 18th anniversary a lot of things happened. Since I lost my virginity when I was 12 a lot of my """"""""""friends"""""""""" asked my help to have girlfriends or how to begin a sexual life without too much problems and how to handle it. I became to get integrate in the class and made my first real friendly relationships (at least I tought) so I learned psychology and how to handle friends. 
I begun to teach lessons after the school in an class near the study room of the school during 2 years, I helped as much as possible everyone who didn't understood something and I even went to some of them's houses around 10PM the days before exams to help them. I managed this, I listenned to their problems sometimes late in the night and helped them to solve it, I litteraly carried 20 lifes that were for me nothing but simple compared to mine and one day I fell on the ground after my day at school. I went back home, said ""Hi mom! How was your day?"" (I didn't saw her a llt because at this moment she worked 60 hours a week because we were 4 to live in the house and life became extremely expensive) and I fell appart. I made a burn-out when I was 16 years old. I stopped teaching in the classroom after the school and helped only one girl with teaching because I knew that without me she wouldn't pass her exams. (Actually she's studying to become social worker because I inspired her.)
After this my depression got worse and worse because my mother didn't stand under the pressure of her work and became more and more alcoholic.
My father's mind fell apart so I went back by him to help him. I graduated from the experimental program and my mother met her first love back. We moved out (I moved out at least 8 times during my life actually) by his house and I tried university in biology...

I think that life want me to suffer because I fell in love with a girl that was perfect, she listenned to my and the story of my life, I listenned to her and we got in couple. In december 2018 my grandfather had an cerebrovascular accident right before christmas and my exams in january. I move by my father because he lived closer to the University and so I could sleep more than 4 hours per night. Even tough i studied as I could but don't passed any exams. 3 month later my girlfriend lost two of her grand parents and by my side my father tried to kill himself, I arrived in time to stop him and he went to the hospital. I lived alone in a big house for 2 month, it was hard with the pressure of the university, my girlfriend depressed with the lost of their grand parents and my father in the hospital after an attempt to kill himself. The result: I said something horrible without noticing it directly and didn't erase the message at time (on messenger) so she broke with me right before the exams in july... I passed 2 exams on the 9. I was close for some of them with 9.8/20 but I was too tired.. Exhausted of this life and I said fuck off to the university. I had nobody to help me, I was and am alone since I'm born. Without anybody to try to understand me. I'm now learning in computing and programming since I think like a computer. A couple of days ago I lost my grandfather, he finally died after 2 years of dying slowly in the hospital. Everytimes saying to me that he suffer. My dad is always alcoholic, my mom have a better life since I left her home so I don't want to bother her with my problems (I already tried and it was catastrophic). My best-friend has his problems and I can't ask him help. My sister is rebuilding herself slightly. And me I'm carrying my whole family even if I'm completely broken in pieces. I can't cry anymore even if I want or need it. A lot of things have the taste of blood, my vision often goes dark and nothing brings me fun. I'm bored constantly. 

Here I resumed my life, I didn't tell everything. It would take a lot of time. Too much time.

If you read this thank you, it already helped me a bit. At least I hope it because I'm so stressed and depressed that I lost sleep years ago. 

This world sucks, I've been born in the wrong time or in the wrong world. I don't enjoy anything anymore and sometimes I get lost in my dreams of another world where I can finally feel peace in my heart and mind. That's the last thing that make me cry..

My Experiences When Shopping,3,"I hope I found the right thread :/

I would just like to say I'm capable of going shopping by myself. When ever I go to jbhifi the person who I often spoke to wasn't too rude. Some employees are straight up rude and unhelpful, but it was the fact that they seemed to know me and when ever I go to tweed city jbhifi they always give me a stare and act like I'm a f$cking criminal. Not to long ago when I went to jbhifi to grab something... can't remember what it was, one of the dudes there asked where my parents were. Like wtf, C$$t I'm 17 nearly 18 I don't need a parent by my side to do basic shopping, like where's your friendly employee attitude. This happens all the time with other things like not giving a clear explanation on a particular product and such... keep in mind I'm friendly to them always. In fact I don't go shopping really at all. The only time I go shopping is when I wanna get myself something legendary, or rarely go with my mum or dad or just with mates.

I Had a fight with my dad,4,"Let me lay it out for you all. I am 24 still living at home with my parents still looking for work. Been on and off jobs for the last year not in a financial position to move out yet. Want to be a full time writer and been doing well to build up a following, been working on my craft and decided to go to uni, starting this year. 
Considering i pay rent agreed between my father and I, and pay for my own rego, insurance, clothes, things i want or need, the only thing my rent contributes is food, electricity and water. I help around the house, do what needs to be done and apply for jobs still. He believes he can dictate what i can and can't do because i am in his words living under his roof and his word is always law. I believe that no longer applies to modern times. It is my house just as it is my siblings, my mums and his.
My dad, he's a boomer, doesn't believe you have to apply online, goes with '""call them up or walk in to speak with manager or call after the interview and do a follow up."" Thinks I have to be out of the house, believes that i should no longer be here cause of my age. I am in his eyes a financial burden.
Now my sister, she's a full time uni student learning to be a dr. She turns 20 this year, doesn't pay rent, rego, insurance, all of that is covered by dad as he agreed to do so and stated he would have done the same if i went into uni straight from highschool. My parents run a business and my sister works the small hrs she is given and hold tight onto that money. Spending it more on her GF than anything. 
All of this is frustrating as dad doesn't approve with my choice to be a writer. He doesn't approve of the course i had chosen, he's not supportive of anything i do, and throws back in my face that he helped me get jobs and how i should be thanking him and blaming me for cocking it up. I gave them my best, many admired that i got up everyday and go to work despite the bullying that went on and still he deemed as ""she could have done better.""
The argument: I clapped back at my dad, trying to lecture me on how to be an adult, how i should work like him because he chose to buy a business and do shit for it, he hates that i have free time and tries to offload more things onto me when there is no need. I have three younger siblings who do less than me. Says he's the only one with a job yet my mum runs the business from home. Stated my sister doesn't pay rent i and i do, as well with rego and insurance and she doesnt pay a cent. Telling me i should get a job, yet i have been applying for months, tell me to move out and so i throw back why i should, putting my foot down telling him he does not dictate my life or my sisters lives and that i do what needs to be done in the house, pay for rent and help when its needed, therefore he shouldn't have a say about anything i do.
In the end he says I'm going to get a rude shock and found out later he plans to make me pay for a sixth of everything. I'm not going to let it happen.
I am sorry for the long post but i wanted to tell someone. Its the first time where i have stood up for myself as my father has been controlling of me for a very long time.",fblmhv

Where to start?,2,"I have a great idea/invention, but have no idea where to start with it in terms of protecting that idea while trying to sell it or find investors.

The first place I would try to sell it to is Amazon. It's that big of an idea that it would transform what is already a great platform and ultimately would create so much more user/brand engagement than they already have with their review systems.

The place I would try to bring it based on the spirit of this idea/invention alone though would be Patreon or maybe even HitRecord.

It could also be done through Kickstarter/finding investors and putting together a founding team... which... honestly is incredibly overwhelming for someone with only recently slightly better managed ADHD and starting from the ground up.

That being said... does anyone know anything about where to start or someone they could connect me with to discuss this idea/invention?

It could very well be a multi-million dollar idea that revolutionizes a whole area of the media we consume regularly... and I could really use the money 📷 If you play a pivotal part of this getting off the ground, I will make it worth your while when we succeed.",rlmnow

[App Idea] Alternative Product App. Boycott with choice and precision.,0,"To begin, Our Next Arc is a movement. We make no money, not even from donations. 

We are done doing business with entities that destroy our planet, ruin lives, and murder to protect profit. We are doing all we can to fight back and an app like this will be an invaluable tool.

If you can build it, then do it. Take full credit. We don't care. This isn't about us - this is about having a tool to fight back against destructive corporations and their financiers in a meaningful way. All that said, let's get to it.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

In order to help consumers break away from businesses that have committed atrocities, we need to make it easy for them to find alternatives to products from companies that are more ethical. 

Sustainability is great, but it's not our primary focus. Our larger focus is on draining business away from places like Nestle, Blackrock, etc, so that money can get into the hands of businesses that willingly do better. Sustainability is inevitable as a part of being an ethical business and will come in time - but it needs funding and this will help them get it.

The idea is for an ""Alternative Product Finder"" app that leads consumers to these better products/businesses/services. There are examples of apps that ALMOST get there, but don't go all the way as we need in being selective about who the alternatives are.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

App Function:

1) Any barcode can be scanned

2) Complete information is displayed about the product . This would be similar to:

[https://www.barcodelookup.com/](https://www.barcodelookup.com/) App that lets you scan 300mil barcodes and get info on the products

[https://www.programmableweb.com/api/open-eangtin-database](https://www.programmableweb.com/api/open-eangtin-database) is an API claiming it allows you to scan/search barcodes to find alternatives as well. No clue how to put this to use.

3) Alternative products are displayed. For ONA's purposes, these alternatives will be carefully selected to only display alternatives belonging to companies with a good reputation. In overall function, a close example is:

[https://alternativeto.net/](https://alternativeto.net/) Great site that lists alternatives to software and apps

4) Barcodes not in the database can be added by the user and then vetted by ONA to ensure it's a company we should support

5) App is free

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

How hard would this be? What would be needed?

I challenge anyone capable of doing this, go ahead and do it. Just let us know when you've done it so we can put it to use and promote it as much as possible. 

This isn't about me or ONA - this is about making a tool readily available to the public so we can start to fight back with our choices in how we spend our money. Please make this if you're capable and willing. We need you to do build this. You need you to build this.",rmcpjg

Your All-in-one Off-grid Power Solution | Solar Generators,2,"[BLUETTI](https://www.bluettipower.com/) is so much more than just a brand name; it is a way of life, a design philosophy, our hope for a better earth, a blue sky, and much more.



From a single idea - a portable, powerful source of electricity - we've built out a whole line up of solar power storage products for adventurers and all kinds of off-grid lives..



[BLUETTI](https://www.bluettipower.com/) Power Inc, based in Les Vegas, is the leading world manufacturer of solar energy facilities including solar generators, photovoltaic panels, and related accessories. Its energetic residential power stations launched in the past two years-AC200P, EP500, and AC300 have stood out from the promising solar solution market, and now it ventures to integrate the innovative sodium-ion battery technology into its upcoming solar products.



Recently [BLUETTI](https://www.bluettipower.com/) has announced the world’s first sodium-ion solar generator-NA300 and its compatible battery pack - B480 on its social medias



It is said that the NA300 and B480 seamlessly inherit all the style and appearance settings of its predecessor – EP500 Pro, especially four 20A plugs and one 30A L14-30 output ports driven by the built-in 3,000W pure sine wave inverter to juice up most household electrical appliances. Besides, the NA300 further outstrips the EP500 Pro’s incredible 2,400W solar input to 3,000W. It may be cited to be the fastest charging solar generator since it can be recharged from 0% to 80% in a short half-hour by 6,000W swift AC + PV dual charging. (3,000W Max. for both AC and PV)

However, NA300 provides a capacity of 3,000Wh, less than the 5,100Wh of EP500 Pro in the same size owing to the current sodium-ion battery technology limitations. Favorably, it supports up to two B480 battery modules (4,800Wh each) for a whopping total capacity of 12,600Wh, and the unit can sustain the constant supply for a family electricity needs for several days or even a week in grid failures or natural disasters with recharging by the solar panels. Additionally, NA300 also offers the 240V, 6000W connection with a Fusion Box and another NA300, IoT App Remote Control by iOS or Android, and other EP500 Pro’s merits.

[Bluetti](https://www.bluettipower.com/) is and always will prioritize design, service, and quality over everything else. One of the most important aspects to us when designing new products is that we use the highest quality, longest-lasting materials available.

"3 ways to move (mouse) cursor: knob wheels for x and y direction, direction wheel + speed slider and buttons for fast and slow move",1,"Different mouse controls for different uses and for different software. Computer in a moving car may benefit from different physical user interface than tabletop or lap.

In some places, multiple input methods can be in use at once.

Knobs for height and width give precision. Some software, like Blender 3D has 3d cursor that could use knob for depth too, so there is x, y and z axis control. 

For some use, knob could point angle from 0 to 360. Other knob, slider or buttons could control speed of cursor movement to that direction. 

One possibility is to have direction buttons for both fast and slow movement and mid-angles, like this:


https://i.redd.it/njoupu13m1781.png

Double arrow means fast. Center button stops movement.

Fake ""buttons"" and ""knobs"" on touch screens are bad / far from ideal. Buttons, knobs, sliders and joysticks should be steel or wood.",rlzoyb

New music app for collaborative or fun fans—artists,1,"An app that is collaborative, in the sense of upload of music— a different platform aimed at engaging with viewers or collaborative ones, moreso groups n a chat aimed at assisting fans or artist group hopefully together on sharing remixes new lines different beats n collaborative in grand ways easily like your swiping on bands like tinder peak new songs come in with a fresh line or a similar song/beat and perhaps focusing on YouTube since collaborative brings music videos or remix capabilities adds more for the artist and a great growing sense for the fans. so it’d be focused on creation there could be pools or groups of people like a chat for social or lyrics and don’t think about pay when it can be endorsed or sponsored! that can pay well and used as a group lottery amongst artist and collaborators. with collaborative ness and a vast genre or arrray of topics on songs it could have its own twitch channel for artist while Covid is still apparent for some you kinda get what I’m getting at? I’ve ran through it in my head I think if you make a song special for one it could be special for many or learn something that you’d include in another special song, but this could be better for an artist in a switch of genre hopefully have all the artists music stream able or at least a link",rqqhmk

Telepathy device,2,"We have technology already that can see what someone is thinking. That can interpret what someone is saying. The technology we have must be right on the head because our brainwaves are weak.

What if you put a small device on the head, that interprets what the brain is saying, that then transmits those waves in the form of radio waves, that transmits them to someone's receiver on someone's else's head that then uses another process to transmit the image or words into someone's mind? 

If we have the technology that can decode what the brain is saying, we should be able to have technology to send information back into the brain. 

You could also take a step back, and just use the device to transmit sound waves for people to hear, or radio/wifi waves to be picked up on devices like phones for people that can't talk or move. Or you could transmit short short wifi waves for close communication or other radio waves to talk to people farther away to which a device, perhaps utilizing an app, will interpret those signals. I could see someone who cannot talk or move to be able to talk to their family easily in the house, or be able to talk to their family a long way away just thinking about it.

You could also just do a slight surgery that connects the device to the brain as well if it was needed. Additionally, you would be able to control some electronic devices, and hear what's around you in radio waves by tuning your telepathy device.",rs64d7

Help with best path forward,1,"Hi everyone, I'm seeking some advice about how to move forward.

I have an idea in the works. I've been doing everything I can to bring it to life with absolutely no experience. Unfortunately, I've hit a roadblock in the prototype phase. One piece of my design didn't work and I have a few redesigns I'd like to try. Here's my problem: I can't get the new pieces to work out in the 3D software, and I believe it is because I am so inexperienced and am still lacking ability. I'm using free Tinkercad. 

Would you recommend spending more time on learning 3D design and/or spending on better software or hiring someone to help me with this piece? What do I need to do in regards to keeping all rights if I hire someone?

question about utility of the Intermediate Axis Theorum,1," 

Hello, I started work on a design for a gyroscope style device with an aim at generating power from the gearing up of energy through the three axis.

I built a device with three rings of smaller, middle, and larger size with bearings and carefully balanced to freely rotate.  
The rings were energized with magnets and coils so that an electric pulse would make it spin

I began by studying the interactions of the rings - I could spin the largest one and it would get the smallest one going, with interesting side effects. The momentum would periodically get stopped by the middle ring sort of hiccupping. I had discovered (and later researched) the Intermediate Axis Theorum, and believe that is what was happening to effectively stop the rotation of the rings.

I find this behavior of spinning objects very interesting, and it also stands in the way of my energy generator gear thingamabob. So I started to think of ways to USE THE INTERMEDIATE AXIS THEORUM, something I haven't seen anyone do.

Has anyone created an application for the IAT?  
Does anyone with an advanced knowledge of physics want to wade into this?  
Can the force that occurs to flip the intermediate axis be harnessed?  
Would a perfectly timed reversal of poles negate the middle ring's desire to flip (allowing it to accelerate in the one direction physically by alternating direction of current internally)?

Point me in the right direction?

Thanks",rqapir

2. MagicFox - Create your own interactive storybook online powered by GPT-3. Describe your story in a few sentences and see it unfold automatically.
3. A chrome extension that will read your content and analyze it based on keywords to find out if you're using them right in a post and suggest new ones.
4. TodoBeater - To-do chrome extension with a timer, but that's not all. TodoBeater is a time management app that allows you to set your priorities and schedule your day in the most efficient way possible. You can even add timers to each task and get reminded in-browser when it's time to move on.
5. A new type of mobile app for exploring new places with their urban legends, rumors, ghosts stories, and true facts about the area. You can explore by location or search for any specific place or story of your interest.

My favorite from these is definitely #5, but the most potential I think #1 has, especially if someone can target people in long-distance relationships.

Solar powered desalinization power station,3,"This would function similarly to how a molting salt solar facility works. Mirrors would focus light from a wide area onto a container filled with salt water turning it to steam. This stream would then be fed through a stream turbine then condensed. The fresh water then could be purified and used in municipal water supplies. The power generated from the turbine could be used locally or even be used to operate a membrane desalinization process to increase the fresh water output.

Since water boils at a much lower temperature than salt melts the collection area needed would be much smaller so plants would be smaller.

"To compete with Multiversus and Nickelodeon All-Star Brawl as Smash competitors, Disney should make its own ""Smash clone""",0,"Ideally this would just be classic Disney characters as Marvel has Marvel Vs. Capcom and Star Wars has Star Wars: Hunters. And yes there are characters in Disney movies that I think would suit a fighting game that aren't just ""animals being heavies a la Donkey Kong"" (though of the animals I can think of multiple Jungle Book characters that'd work) e.g. Merida and Mulan are obvious roster includes, I've been saying Elsa would suit Smash (and therefore would suit a Smash-alike) since Fighters Pass 2 came out, and even the newest movie Encanto could have some reps despite the heroine's lack of powers as Luisa and Isabela have fighting-game-worthy Gifts (the former would be your typical ""heavy"" fighter (I don't think any Smash-esque game has ever really had a female heavy so that'd be breaking new ground) while the latter would be more of a Zelda-esque character like Elsa would be). And that's just the movies as while it'd be too weird to have someone from the live-action shows there's plenty of potential fighters from the cartoons like Luz from The Owl House (each of her specials etc. could be taken from a different coven's discipline of magic) or Phineas from Phineas And Ferb (who'd be a ""gimmick fighter"" like Villager/Isabelle) or less recent characters like Kim and Shego from Kim Possible or the eponymous American Dragon: Jake Long.

And a ""Disney Smash"" would also lend itself to some really cool stage locations like Ahtohallan or the Beast's castle or some sort of multiple-phase Mulan thing where you're fighting everywhere from the mountains (perhaps with an avalanche hazard) to the rooftops and just imagine the music (sure some of it might be kinda inappropriate for a fighting game even if it's all instrumental but how would fighting to something like Part Of Your World be any less jarring than the more mellow Smash tracks like Brewster's Roost or Swan Lesson). And new fighters coming from new movies or shows would be announced with the thing while new post-launch ones from old properties would be announced like a Smash one would be.

Now the question is, would multiverse shenanigans require Sora to be playable in this too with his Smash moveset (or as close as it'd translate with a potentially different setup) and what would that mean for both multiverses' future connections? ;)",ru526a

Folks go on vacations, travel and call out in droves. People are forced to return to work when they really don’t want to which causes  poor morale and work ethic. If you give most people at least the week of Christmas off, I guarantee you wouldn’t deal with as much issues with call outs and no shows.

Idea to make a new Kowloon city,16,"So, my plan is to have a person buy about 100 acres of land and then invite anyone and everyone to come and build and live in hopefully leading to a city closely resembling Kowloon walled city before it was demolished in 1993. The total 100 acres would be mostly used for a solar farm to power the city the city itself would only take up around 10 acres comprised of around 1000 buildings if we go of the Kowloon city blueprint. Housing a max population of 500000 people considering that we could build higher than 14 stories the restriction Kowloon had due to its proximity to an airport. The area that I think would be best to build this city is northeast Texas due to its central location and land availability. Water could be collected off of the sloped surfaces of the solar panels allowing for a total collection of 200 Millon gallons per year assuming there are 28 solar panels per acre and each one is 4000ft² and the average rainfall is 34 inches. All the water could be stored underground and on top of buildings as instead of a water tower. With each building likely costing around 10 million that is 10 billion dollars and the solar panels costings 45 million and 1 billion for infrastructure the total comes out to be 11045 million just to build. However, if each person of the assumed half million population pays 22090 dollars, then it will all be paid for all you would have to do is move in.",rogek9

So since then I’ve always had this little inkling of an idea of a bunch of stories set in a fantasy world, but where it really tries to emphasize how normalized all of the ridiculous fantasy shit is. I’m thinking of things like how some ‘adventurers’ become insanely rich and even affect the politics of major kingdoms and states like in most fantasy settings but then bringing in the perspective of more mediocre adventurers and how it isn’t so glorious and kinda sucks and they struggle to get by dealing with relatively minor problems like the occasional weak magical monster. Maybe something about a group of average soldiers and the issues they have with coming face to face with horrible monsters and legendary warriors that have god-like speed and strength. A merchant who has to deal with magic being an ever present issue and trying to avoid getting scammed by wizards. Stuff like that. 

I don’t know if this has been done before, I’m not really into much contemporary fantasy but I always thought this was a cool idea.",ro4dkq

How do you find a developer/dev company to help make a prototype?,1,"Hey all, 

How does someone with an invention idea go about developing a working prototype without themselves being a tech person? Say the idea were a wearable device that interacts with your computer via bluetooth--how would you go about finding someone to work with on actually getting that idea out of the imagination/sketch phase, and into real engineering and ultimately working form?

Are there companies that are well known for that space that are also trustworthy? What types of protection does one need in order to protect the idea from being stolen? Do such companies usually take up front fees or ask for a % of rights? 

Pretty new to all this and much of the research I am finding online is geared towards getting prototypes made for objects--ie things that can be 3d printed and don't also need to function electronically--or for apps, which are a different thing entirely.

Couldn’t all electric cars have a uniform design for the battery pack so that it could be removable and that way you had the option of either carrying spare batteries so that you could pull over and swap them out so it goes back to 100% then just charge them back up at home or petrol stations could have a 3 tier system in which you buy one of there battery packs and when you then finally run low you just disconnect and swap it for one they have already charged at a discounted cost depending the tier you buy

Arkbase can be viewed as a virtual reef where inventors, developers, and investors come together to nurture invention ideas that will change the way things are done. We help abstract ideas get exposure in a crypto-safe environment. What that means is all ideas that are shared on our platform are secured through a Public Ledger Technology (PLT) which saves every transaction in multiple locations and gives a public receipt back in seconds. This allows inventors to bring their supporters in this safe place to discuss the development of their ideas. Once a brainstorming session is concluded, a vote can be taken in a similar decentralized way.

Though voting can usually be considered a complicated process, services like [snapshot.org](https://snapshot.org/) make it easy and transparent. As mentioned in our [previous blog](https://www.arkbase.co/post/token-economics-serving-inventions) about token economics, early investors, along with inventors’ families and friends, are the actual decision-makers through their position of the invention coin. They get to decide where the funds get allocated and what direction should the developing team go. Now the developers, or contributors as we like to call them, are a bit different, they have two ways to join the community and a lesser commitment option. They can either buy tokens in projects they believe in or work their way in.

Developers’ compensation through tokens solves the inventor’s main current problem, being prey to bottom feeders. Getting paid through tokens means that it is in the interest of the developers to do a good job and stick around as long as possible. A CAD designer, for example, can choose to work for an invention and get paid in a token that is worth 0.2 dollars and then stick around and participate in the cross-pollination and voting processes that can bring the value of such a token up to 0.5 or 1 dollar. This process is unique to Arkbase and promises all with a stake in the invention of a democratized environment where every voice is heard and every token held is weighed.

Hair bruch New generation,1,"please excuse my english if it is not perfect.  it would be a product that would target female customers much better.
 I explain;  Your hair, unfortunately, has a terrible natural tendency to absorb the odors around you and the bacteria in it.  Whether it's while smoking or hanging out with smokers, coming out of a workout, staying in a room that smells too much, or even being out on the street for too long.  You feel the need to remove those odors and unwanted effects that are damaging your hair.  However, you may not have the time or the inclination to start your treatment and wait for it to work.
 This is why we created an innovative solution to enable consumers of cosmetic products to use their hair care more effectively.  We are therefore looking to create a new generation hairbrush, which will have the direct capacity to apply your care.  This brush can receive what are called ""doses"", this variety of doses will be composed of different types of products: exotic perfumes, essential oils, moisturizing lotions ... the consumer can choose the doses of his choice, which correspond to his  current needs, and can insert them inside the brush (where a compartment will be created beforehand).  This is how, while brushing their hair, the recipient can spray the contents of the dose that they have inserted onto their scalp.  To do this, all he has to do is press a button on the handle of this brush and the pressure system will do the rest of the work.
 This brush will offer the ability, at the same time, to perfume your hair with a sweet scent of vanilla while being at work or at school, but it will also allow you to apply specific care much more in depth.
 Transportable, discreet and easy to use, consumers can take care of themselves at any time.",rxs436

Smart-Fridge,3,"A smart fridge could have a barcode scanner to allow you to quickly and conveniently scan every item on the way in or out so your fridge knows almost everything that's in it. For other produce it might have a couple of weight plates and the standard grocery checkout selection menu so you can manually enter anything else that might not be contained within supermarket databases or have a barcode.

This allows for several desires and benefits including:

 Near Real time and accurate tracking of your calories, fats vs protein vs carbs, nutrient profiles and more.
 Automatic re-ordering of certain foods according to your profile options- you might want to select based on calorie count for the week or month, based on a certain diet etc.
 Phone alerts or emails for when something is going bad or running low.
 Adjustable diet plans whenever you want.

This might capture large parts of diet and weight-loss markets and I suspect might also capture parts of the market for products like Huel/Soylent where people want an all-round nutrient profile but without the complications of sorting through all the different groceries available.

Some limitations include:

 Only as accurate as your willingness to scan items.
 Less useful for families and more than 1-2 people.

A Maintenance-Free Device to Keep Air Lines Clean,3,"A friend of mine developed a device that keeps air lines free of build up, eliminating the need to clean them. I presented to upper management at Starbucks roughly two years ago, as they have Nitro coffee in most all of their stores, however Covid soon hit, halting all communication. Here's an excerpt from my original email...

""It takes a Partner roughly 45 minutes a week to properly clean the Nitro lines (assuming it's getting done at all). If that Partner is making $12.00/hour, that's $9.00/week, and $468.00/year per store. With over 30,000 stores, that's over $14,000,000.00 a year Starbucks spends on a service with very little return. 14 million dollars a year. That doesn't even include the cost it takes to bring out a maintenance company to service the machines, with the issue more often than not being due to dirty lines.""

This product is patent pending and I have a prototype ready to go, proving that it works, all without the need of electricity. 

This doesn't only apply to Starbucks, as is works with all air lines, including Nitro coffee, beer, soda, etc.

"The Ocean Side of Earth, Rising Oceans, The Future of Earth & Its Inhabitants",1,"Hey,  So I've had a couple ideas come to me and there's no way they are complete or able to come alive by me alone. So if anything here makes sense to you please share these ideas and get something started;  
1. Free Energy, Basic Necessities, Never ending employment for everyone.  
Check out the ocean side view of earth and think about how humans could use this space to create   
 solar / wind  farms,  & harness kinetic energy from the Ocean waves to create; Free energy for all of humanity, agriculture & building material production, housing & distribution of listed things. To get there we could build floating hexagonal pods that are powered the same way, solar/wind/hydro, to get there and stay while its being built, coming back for materials and stock, but also beginning the production of free necessities via those 3 elements and high efficiency technology, even if we have to remain on fossil fuel to a degree until everything is operational.  

This would change us to a type 1 civilization & turn the Continents of Earth to all first world country status.

 This would also in turn generate basic needs for humans to be born into a world with =/= chances.  No single entity would profit from basic needs anymore, or own this unless it's improved on, or they were the person behind its production and completion. It should be funded and created by all of the nations. Every nation builds a massive pod to set sail / turbo float to the back side where we begin operation: ""Let's make free stuff now that we can, Cause why the hell not.""  


2. Divert rising natural water sources (Lakes, Oceans, etc) with a new highway/tunnel system for aquatic vehicles that are land to water and submersible.   


3. Create trumps massive wall only around the Continents as Kinetic energy harvesters that also serve as wave breakers in the event of a single massive event.. Something far out, or multiple things far out, that will dissipate the strength of a tsunami but not disturb the natural flow of water.    


4. Control the run off water of the Ice caps by creating a water collecting system that collects and brings down fresh water for it to be distributed to 2nd and 3rd world countries until they are 1st world. Or just start bringing down glaciers for them.   


5. Harvest heat energy from volcanos by diverting or tapping into their heat sources without altering the natural surroundings. Kinda just dip some metal toe's in there and let the heat rise and utilize the hot rods.   


6. Take Religion out of everything society has its hand in,  as it is a personal belief and concept some people buy into and some people do not, there's also just too many. Keep Religion at home and in the Churches and what not.  I praise the Sun in a way, but you don't see me throwing it down anyone's throat or writing In Solar Systems We Trust on my cheque's.   


7. Build a newer bigger ISS that is also producing things and drops food / materials / batteries down as it flies over countries / states / provinces  / islands etc  
   
8. Ocean Trash / Recycling collection & sorting facilities. 

9. Ocean plastics recycling facilities that turn plastics into pellets and 3'd print in the Ocean after being sorted from trash.",rygf40

Instead of just a full ban, your account gets suspended if it has been proven that you cheated(through collected, submitted, and peer-reviewed data over time) and you can only recover it by providing information regarding who you got your cheats from. The cheater then gets their account back, with a 3-strike system put in place where on the 3rd offense, the account is fully banned.


The point of this is data collection to more easily attack the source of the cheats rather than the cheaters themselves. Cheaters can't cheat if the provider can't provide.",rxbicv

App providing Pet transportation services for pet owner to travel with their pets,1,"Some big cities offer solutions to travel with your pet in a taxi or Uber for instance. However, travelling between cities with pets without owning a car is very difficult. The idea is to allow any pet lover who owns a car to promote their next trip online (carpooling app) with the type of pets they are allowing in their vehicle to share the journey. In other words, it is a carpooling app for pet travel. Of course, this will mean that one pet will be considered as an additional passenger and only one family owning pet(s) will be allowed into the vehicle. Travelling from one city to another is very cumbersome with a pet as it usually involves taxi, bus/train and taxi again with pets hopefully being allowed. The current carpooling apps are not pet focused unfortunately and it is not always easy to find a pet friendly owner. Directing the users to the right pet driver for them according to the pet they own, number of people and where they are going is then a key selling point of the app.",rwx2km

Dumb theory on Evolution,1,"
This is an experimental post and it's okay if you think this is dumb ..but I had a lot of fun thinking about it .😂

Idk if it is already somewhere .. someone could have thought about it ..or even discarded it , so no promises there. 

was just studying and chilling watching shows etc .. and this haunting feeling slowly took shape within me .

Just here to blabber as idk what to do with it .

while reading this  You could be intrigued , curious or to say the least .. entertained  Or you could say m high and find plenty of mistakes ... well i don't care ..you can take it anyway you like. Comments and discussion are welcome.

So here it is.

I always wondered evolution agrees survival of fittest.. but never really clicked with what are we doing with so much of cellular organisms and other beings . Well they do survived ofcourse but a what's the purpose kind ..in general .
(No purpose to life ofcourse😂😂)


In All the structure in evolution .. 
We have trancended dimensions .
( I know it's lot more complex than that ..but haven't thought this through)


Organisms evolved from no sense of environment to 3D perception . That's a fact.

Reading all the biolgy we see..

Organnells good at one task came together and made a functioning cell.


Cells evolved from uni cellular to collaborating with other cells with specific diffrentiated functions.

But before this there might be many prokaryotes and unicelluar organism which just evolved in doing and getting better with just what they have.
But once colonizers started to dominate they were in a different league.

Our body is essentially like a planet with really good interconnections between it's cellular residents who all are assingned to do specific functions . Complete with police force , messaging and control systems.
But None can see or feel what we do as a whole.
That is 3D perception.

Let this sink in for a sec. Cauz the cells may not even be aware of the gravity of perception that is available to us.



Maybe ..just maybe 

We are headed there too.

in a sense there exits multiple cellular planets ..like many animals ..
Like the cells..
It's the same for humans .. and a few others like the Termites , which are so good at colonization that there colonies are actually considered to be SUPERORGANISM ..the basis of this discussion.

For what we know maybe the plant population attempt it in forrests .
Anyways the humans could be doing this by means of technology.

For eg . We don't see the light in its full spectrum.
But we know about it and have utilised it to our advantage.
Through extensions of technology.

By internet and other means ..we are making an interconnected society, or at least headed there.

It could get so good to a point that we eventually function like an ORGANISM.

with existence and perception in literally more dimensions than we could imagine.

From 2D cells to 3D organisms ..what next ..

Or we are just cancer to this already existing organism.😅😅

And this is just one organism .. say an Earth (like a human)
Or any other organisms ( elephant ..dog.. or even . Sun .. mars..etc etc 😂)

It would be cool i knw , and yes it could actually also go in completly different direction and we could be near extinction ofcourse, outdone by our own creation...or even singulairty and stuff .😂

But 
Who cares.😊✌️

I enjoyed this.. may be was fun for u too 😅
Peace .",rwgw4r
