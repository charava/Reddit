Work problems...,9,"So I work at an elementary school through Americorps right? When the schools closed down, the principal (one of my bosses) asked me to check in every day with the vice-principal, Minh. I asked if we could make it a weekly check-in but the vice principal said since principal said we gotta do every day, it's what I have to do.

Well, I did forget some days of the week to check-in. And so my Americorps Supervisor calls me to yell (rant) at me for it.

She's been very inconsistent with the requirements with this whole check-in even though I'm checking in with just the vice principal and not her. Our check-ins are separate. Mind you her job is to make sure I'm doing my job at the school which is why shes concerned with the check-in between me and the vice principal.

In April, since I forgot a couple more days, she called again. And ranted over and over how I'm not professional and even threatening to fire me because I'm being so unprofessional for not checking in with the vice principal. She told me she doesn't care what time I check in just as long as I do it? Since my work at home hrs have been so...all over the place.

Technically it was our Spring Break when I forgot that time so I didn't it was such a big deal.

Well, today she called (EVEN THOUGH I HAVE CHECKED IN every day) and RANTED OVER AND OVER how so I'm so unprofessional and how my check-in times are so late. I asked her what time does she want me to check-in? And I didn't get a specific time. So I send my daily check in to vice-principal and say ill be checking in at 1 pm every day. Then she texts me and says ""NO the requirement is 12:00pm""

She's being very inconsistent with her requirements and expectations and I'm getting sick of her threatening to fire me over this stupid check-in.

Hearing someone call you unreliable, unaccountable, unprofessional, etc. over and over. I cried during our call but I muted it bc I was trying so hard to stay professional.

She said she will not be my reference for whatever job I may be getting next...mind you, I never asked her to.

I don't know what to do. I want to report this to her boss and talk to my vice principal but I don't how to explain it to them.

Thank you for reading this whole thing...I really could use some professional advice on this if there is anything I can do.",g2x57f
I'm stuck in another country with my mom and step-father who apparently can't stop fighting each other,13,"Hi

Well, I'm originally from South America, I live there with my dad. This February I had to come to Europe, where I lived in for seven years before I went back to my country, so I could help my mom take care of my little brothers until she recovered from a serious surgery. My step-father and her are separated, he usually stays in another city because of work and then comes to the city my mom lives in for two weeks so he can see the kids. That's all good, it works for them, but quarantine messed things up, since my step-dad can't go back to the city. My mom and him fight absolutely all the time, sometimes it's over serious problems and sometimes over really small things. It has been like this since I was 13 years old (I'm currently 21), that's why they separated.

The thing is, all of this is taking a toll on my mental health and I haven't been able to go back to my country. The embassy and airline won't answer my emails. I'm getting sick of it, plus I'm starting online classes.

I don't know how I will manage to stay sane. I've tried talking to them calmly, yelling, putting on my headphones on full volume so I can't hear them, going to another room but it doesn't work since the apartment is tiny and I don't have a bedroom for myself.

What can I possibly do? I'm genuinely desperate.",g2oc25
Online school (not serious),5,"This is very mild, and will probably make me sound bratty, but here we go. I had a science project I had to hand in, and usually my teacher would pester us to hand in every part of the assignment (understandably). But because of online school, I forgot to. I handed in the main assignment, but forgot all my research notes. What’s stranger is that I handed in the works cited on a separate page, but had no notes attached. When I got the mark back, I noticed the big fat 0 next to the research notes. I put a lot of effort into them, so I assume I would’ve gotten perfect. My mark would’ve went from an 81% to a 95%, and it infuriates me. I’ve always been soft and broke down at the smallest thing, so this made me very sad, then angry, then quiet. I know this isn’t even really a problem, but it could’ve been avoided if Corona wasn’t happening. Stay safe, do your work, hand it in, wash your hands. I want this whole mess to be over soon.",g2nycw
"im fat, depressed and tired and imma blame it on the lockdown :)",7,"ok so this quarantine has completely fucked me over



i started out with the intent to exercise, but due to my extreme procrastination that plan has been completely flushed, and i (believe i) have packed on a decent amount of fat that wasnt there beforehand. on top of this, i have insomnia, and i never take sleeping pills as they leave me with a migraine, so if i do sleep, its 4am or later. my body seems to have calibrated itself to wake up at 3pm because of this, giving me no time to do ANYTHING.

so, i need either ways to motivate myself, or very easy and quick workouts, and ways to sleep without pills.

any tips? honestly im open to try anything right now. hell, ill even try home remedies.",g26zrr

"My dad left, came back but left again...",9,"Thank you for reading. You can submit your own stories too. 



I feel like i have to speak about this to someone but i feel like there really isn't anybody that is feeling the same. Similar yes for sure.  I just need to get this off my mind.

So my mom and dad wasn't like married together when my mom got pregnant but they did know each other for looong time since childhood so it wasn't like a one night thing you know. But he took off and my mom find out that he had a child coming a few moths away from my birth.  He chose not to be in my life than. So i never saw him. I had one picture of him but i lost it. 

2017 He joined to Facebook and messaged to my mom. He asked how i was doing and if i wanted to see him on Saturday. He was going to some amusement park whit my two brothers. That Saturday i had school and i had this important role to host the event there so i couldn't go. After that he didn't ask to meet again. And why he contacted my mom was and i quote ""My wife died and that kinda woke me up that everything is not forever"" he said. I friended him on Facebook too but he never talked to me, just my mom. In 2019 he posted MY name and my 3 brothers names tattooed on his fingers. And i remind you i have never talked to this man before. Few months later he post the ""In a relationship"" thing in Facebook and weeks later deletes Facebook and i and my mom lost all contact to him. He took off again. 

I'm not sad about it just mad. Because i let him to make me believe that something was going to happen but nothing did.  One thing that i kinda would want is relationship whit my brothers but than i don't want anything to do whit them or my dad. It's just all really confusing...



If you have something bothering your mind share it. It helps you to kinda put things in order if that makes any sense and there's someone that listens you.",g1z4rx

My close friends for three years in high school are cutting me off,9,I have three best friends throughout my high school life. After many bad experience with friendship groups and drama. I have finally found my close friends in high school which is my ex three close friends now. How it all started in my opinion and what I’m about to express is what I feel like happened and it could be different on what they have seen or what their side of the story could be. I first met two of my best friends in the end of year 7 when I was bullied with my other toxic friendship groups and when I first met them they were very nice and understanding. They would tell me they would always be here whenever I have problems and they always listened to me complain or rant about my family problems or issues in my life time. I would sometimes make funny jokes like for example how people act and stupid dad jokes. They all laughed and they would always hype me up for the jokes I made and it actually made me happier that someone could finally understand me for who I am. So then my jokes got more funnier and they would laugh more louder. After one year pasted my two close friends made friends with another girl and she joined our group and to be honest at first I disliked her and was jealous of her because she was used to be from the popular group and I hated the way she acted. While I started to feel excluded and left out of the group. So I told my two close friends about how I felt and they completely Ignored my opinion. Pretending nothing has happened. While days kept going on I stoped mentioning my problems about the new girl in our group and started to communicate with her and hang out with her more often thinking then I would be able to fit in more. But as time went she’s actually gorgeous and an out going person and I actually got closer with her more than my other two best friends. The four of us are all having fun and talk together through out our last year of high school. Soon time went out and things started to go down. My problems got worse and I would want people to listen to my thoughts I try not to always complain to them about it and I would often hear them complaining about things in their life’s and I found it equal because that’s what friends do. But then soon I found out that my friends are once again distancing themselves with me. I tired to find reason and I learn from my past mistakes in other friendship groups until I finally said it out to them that I felt left out again. Then they finally all stood up and talked about the problems but it never came to a conclusion because everyone was just crying about the situation and ranting out all my mistakes and they never talked about their own. They told me they are sick of me ranting. They are sick of my jokes because it makes them feel uncomfortable and weird about themselves. But I found it really weird because they never told me instead blaming the problems all on me and telling me how I am the person causing all the dramas in this friendship group. But that’s not my intention to cause drama. I just wanted to make them happy and laugh so all my jokes are just to make them happy when they are upset and my problems I could not talk about it again only if you guys could of told me earlier. Instead of telling me at the end the year when everyone is gonna graduate soon. They said that my problems are affecting their own mental health and it’s killing them and they are sad because they have enough problems on their mind too. But I hate the fact that they didn’t tell me and I asked them that too and what they told me was they hide it away from me thinking they will get judged about their opinions on things if they stated their opinions on things I did or said and it made me really really upset. Because I thought we were all best friends and if we talk about things and if we don’t like it you have to say it out because then none of us will change for the better. It made me feel like a shit head that I am not counted as a friend because they hide their most important thoughts in things away from me. I could still remember that day where all four of us were crying our brains out. But all their problems were targeted towards me that I am the problem and drama causer. That day was the last day of school since the school got shut down the next day because of the coronavirus going on. So none of us get to solve or talk it out. So I send them each are very very important text message and explained my wrong and hope they would accept my apology. But instead they turned really cold to me and started to lash out everything on how I made their life’s horrible and things are never gonna be the same anymore. It’s a build up problem because since year 7 they would laugh in my jokes and told me that they would always listen and be by my side when problems rises and I know people do change over time but these words hurt me the most that my friends are leaving me because of me trying my hardest to fit in. I apologised for what I did in the past to create this problem. But they never apologised for the words they said or called me. That’s what made me sad and proud at the same time. That I admitted what I did wrong in this friendship even though I think I really didn’t because it was a misunderstanding of communication since they NEVER told me what they are thinking. But I can also understand them at the same time because it’s hard to tell one of your friends about this. I admit what I did and I’m proud of that. They didn’t do it and it’s ok because everyone has their own choice. It’s their Choice to do what they think is correct and in the end they decided to cut me of. They said we can acquaintances but every time when I text them like “hi” or “how are you” they Igrone me or leave me on read. I realised that just some things that caused them to turn completely cold to me. I guess In the future I will learn from my mistakes and find a true friend who will understand me better than high school.,g1r9qq
Brother,5,This is my first time telling anyone about this so my older brother scares me when we were younger he would do anything in his power to keep my mouth shut about him dipping or smoking he’d pin me down on the floor and hit me and as time went on it got worse one day he just came in my room and just started hitting me  as his friends just watch in the doorway and more recently he’s been getting into drugs and cussing out my mom and threatening to kill me to get money out of my mom luckily i did get out of these situations mostly unharmed ever since then I’ve been having nightmares about him killing me or my little brother and it feels like it might happen this whole situation with my brother has caused a lot of problems for me and I don’t what to do,g1eixl

I hate my family (especially my brother) I wish he can just disappear or something,5,"I don’t want to be mean or selfish but I think I am  now because I am gonna put it here about how shitty and nasty my younger brother is. On all the shit he has caused me and made me who I am now. How many of my fucking mental health are linked from what he had done. My family were always fighting and we’re very violent with each other so since when I was young. I had many bad experience with it and I hated home. I use to think I lived in such a perfect life. Not until my brother was born. His two faced since when he was young. He would show his cute innocent side to my mum or dad or anyone in the family tree just to get sympathy and love. While he treats me and my younger sister with disrespect and hate. He would spit on me every time when I get out of the shower clean. Throw dirt on my clean washed blanket thinking it’s so fun to see my reaction. Pick his nose and wipe it at me. Bite his toe nail and throw it at me or in my room when I’m not around. Wear his dirty shoes and jump on my bed. Mess up my clean laundry. Use his dirty hands to touch me and It caused me to have a trauma that my things will never get clean if I’m around that shit head and it turned me into a psycho clean freak that wants everything to be clean. Since he is the second oldest and is the only boy in the three children I found that my love in this family were gone. I’m the oldest and in the Asian family you were expected to do many things for the family. My brother was a little spoiled brat he gets money from my dad and my grandparents since he is the only boy so he is pretty much biased around the family tree. While my younger sister is the youngest so she needs more care and you could say I was jealous that all my love and care was all gone just because I was the oldest I had to work three jobs and the money I earn we’re either taken away by my parents to buy stuff for my brother and sister. I don’t want to live such a horrible life. Even words can’t explain my feelings right now. My brother he swears a lot around the house hold and my parents don’t care because he is spoiled like I said. He would always boss me to be his slave and he will hit me  or pull my hair whenever he doesn’t like something. He takes my stuff without Permission and breaks my books destroy my makeup and items in my room. He yells all the time and one time mum and dad was always fighting about him. Such as one time when my dad cooked him noodles and he doesn’t like it and he started to throw a tantrum mum came and started to yell at my dad because of a cup of noodle on how my brother didn’t like the taste. Such a petty thing to fight for. That day I was the one who had to stop them from fighting and I was protecting my mum from my dad beating her. My brother is too spoiled and that time he was 13 years old. Still acting like a baby. When he was younger about 6 or 7 years old every time when he does something wrong I would get blamed for it since I’m the oldest and I would get hit and beat up. I turned suicidal after many beat up and harassment from my brother and parents. My brother would stole money from my parents and use it for his stupid game. He would take my parents credit card and type in the number and spend about $700 dollars on a freaking game. When he was younger he would stole candies from shops and eggs from our next door neighbours. He takes things with out permission. Every time when I’m sad I would take some animals home, such as rabbits and cat and look after them and put them in our garden.  My brother would harass my cat and play with it really rough and when my cat attacks him for it he would kick my cat. He even stole my bunny rabbit ‘Pluto’ and he will threaten me with many things if he doesn’t get what he wanted because my parents has his back. I would get mad at him and tell him to stop because I’m not a very patient person because I hate my brother since he was young. So some times I would yell at him and tell him to back off for all the shit things he do but then he runs off and acts all innocent to my mum or dad and I would get beat again and yelled at. I just don’t understand. My brother had stole and had break many things in this house hold but my parents just never gets mad at him rather think his doing is good. His never going to learn his lesson and soon he will be raised to be a criminal. Since he is the only boy my parents would never do anything to hurt him and he never had to wash any of his clothes or do any kind of chores around the house. Rather I had to do many things. I hate living my life like this. Really hate it and wish some days it could end.",g10x4e
I get pissed off at ignorance,3,"For example, if someone doesn’t know the answer to a simple question in a group, in my mind I will think “bruh it’s the easiest  stfu” and just kind of go off at myself, it happens all the time and I know it’s wrong because people have different abilities etc etc. Another example is say in a classroom and a teacher explains something basic, and someone then is confused over it after, despite me finding the explanation really simple and self explanatory. Anyone else just sometimes experience this?",g07kls
Past HS drama,0,"So a long time ago in high school, idk why I ever did this I was being really dumb and I regret and I can not stop thinking about this till this day. But I had 2 friends who always talked behind their backs to me. I told my friends that both of them were talking bad about eachother and one of my friends wanted evidence because she thought I was lying. One day my friend talked bad about another friend so I decided to record the conversation and send it. Currently this is the past and these 2 aren’t friends due to other reasons but the friend I recorded knows I did this and she does forgive me. However, the friend that I gave the recording to in high school, her mom is totally crazy and she emailed my high school teacher saying my friend and I bullied the friend in high school. To this day I worry that I made a big mistake by recording the conversation and it will later impact our lives. However I know it’s just high school drama and everyone does talk behind others back. So I’m scared that the mom will like show everyone or the friend that I sent the recording to will show everyone and my other friend will be affected and so will I... 
This happened like 3-4 years ago but I still think to this day I made a bad mistake. Please give me some advice or thoughts.",g06k98

A problem I had for two years,3,"Before I went into middleschool, I was a happy little kid that would always talk to others and make goofy and funny things to make others laugh. Some of the kids that I mess with don't really have a problem with me and sometimes would ask me if I would like to play games in the playground like the floor is lava, tag, and hide n seek. Other kids however (that were mostly girls), saw me as a annoying kid who does dumb things and doesn't know any better. So the girls rarely ever talked to me. Sometimes I would be arguing with some girls since they would act defensive and would sometimes tease for the things I do. Luckily I had a very nice teacher and would diffuse the situation quickly. The girls will sometimes tease me for the things, but it didn't really bother me since me and my friend would always laugh it off. But then, once my elementary days were over and I had to go a middle school for the first time, things got pretty bad.

Once my first day of middle school began, I was sort of shy and didn't really talked that much since my friend from elementary school was going to a different middle school so I had no friends to talk to. My first impression to my classmates wasn't that good, I acted pretty retarded to them as of what I've done to make kids in my elementary school laugh. Once lunch began,  
I sat in a small table were couple of my classmates were sitting in. I attempt to make ""funny"" things that I deeply regret doing like eating things of the floor, eating 
scraps of food that my classmates didn't want, and make weird jokes that weren't really funny at all. Worst part about my classmates was that some of them were girls that were from my elementary school. The girls didn't really like me at all and started spreading rumors about me that would later destroy my reputation with my classmates. Another bad thing about my classmates is a small group of ghetto kids that weren't really nice to others. Once they heard about the rumors, they pretty much started tormenting me everyday calling me names, stealing some of my belongings, and even sometimes threatening me that they were gonna beat me up. I felt powerless because of them. Around the middle of the school year, everyone was pretty much against me, they all pretended I had some disease which they called Ebola and started physically distancing themselves from me, pretty much causing me to be lonely for the rest of the school year. It gotten so bad to a point where everytime 
I sit near to ant of my class, they would scooch away from me or tell to please sit somewhere else. I would also pretend I was sleeping on the table while in reality I was quietly sobbing from all this torment I had to deal 
with every day. Onetime one of the ghetto kids was mad at me for something that I can't remember and started calling names and other bs at me. I then snapped and threw a small milk carton at him and it hit him in his. After this, he told me that me and him are going to fight in bathroom. I was pretty mad at him so I pretty much shrugged it off. Then when my class period started he came to my table and told to follow him into the bathroom. I knew what he was doing so told him no. Then he brought his friend and tried to encourage me to follow him to the bathroom. I got angry at him and quietly threw a cuss word at him. He heard me though, and got pissed off and decided to shove my workbook off my desk. Luckily my teacher finally realizes whats going and stopped the ghetto kid from harassing me. But at that point, I hit my breaking point and started sobbing onto the desk. That day was the day were my personality started to drastically change. After my school uear was finally over and I moved on to 7th grade. I was no longer that happy kid that would always attempt to make funny jokes to make other people laugh. I was now just some kid that barely talked to other.

As of writing this now, Im now a lot more energetic than before and now have friends that I would sometimes talk. But I still don't talk that much to others since I fear that they would gonna tell me to shut up or say that they don't care what im talking. Sometimes though, I would fight off my anxiety by telling myself that if they don't care about the things I say, then just move on and say something else. I would also have these episodes where my confidence to do anything just goes down the drain and their will voices of my classmates in my head telling that whatever I was doing is dumb or tell me that my opinions are dumb.

Sorry you had to hear my long ass sob story about me. Hopefully some of yall can give some advice to deal with my anxiety and these episodes I have.",fxkty1
why i hate him,2,"I don like to do this but im on my last straw. I can't keep it in anymore. My father has ruined my entire life, let me explain. I was once a young kid(not anymore im an adult now) with full of character i was funny, i was well liked and I loved my life up until 8 grade (many years ago) where i got into a huge fight with my ""father"" where he ended up  pulling me up and throwing me on a wall where i got my t shirt ripped I was only 13 at the time but that wasn't the worst part. If it was just that i could've forgiven him however my ""father"" then proceeded to not talk to me for a full year basically was neglected by him not one word. He muted me out. I don't know who does that to their 13 year old son I was still a kid. That obviously ended up destroying me emotionally and mentally. I lost all confidence in myself, I lost my friends, I became socially anxious as i thought i was a good for nothing since even my own father gave up on me, I also became extremely depressed and was suicidal. My chance of having a normal teenage life was done at that point btw all these he caused I am still dealing with them many many years later what also bothers me about is wich kind of parent stops talking to their own little son and how do you not think of the negative mental effects it will have on him. My life became hell at the point. The worst part is that my ""father"" never apologised to me about this as i was pretty much forced after a year to apologise to him. We then started being ""okay"" with each other after that however the damage was already for about 2 years we went on like nothing happened but i wasnt the same still struggling with everything he caused me. I decided to cut him out tho after about 2 years and stop speaking to him due to what he had done years passed. We still live under the same roof tho sadly as i cannot afford a place of my own yet. That's not the only thing that i hate about my ""father"" even though i cannot if he was mentally abusive when i was younger i definitely he would sometimes hit me a bit too much and would scream at me too much. Another thing that cannot ever forgive him for is that he cheated on my mom even though she does everything for him. She cooks, cleans and is borderline his full time servant while he sits and watches tv and gets mad often. So my mom gives her all for him and that loser cheats on her. The only thing he does is he has a hardworking job where he works like 80 hours a week but that doesn't matter as i barely any of the money makes and anyways i want nothing to do with it. He is a good breadwinner tho i can't lie. As of march 2020 i am still dealing with everything my dad caused me mentally my life has been because of him and i've also been suicidal imagine killing myself cause of everything he caused me. Still that the person that is supposed to love me and protect me gave up on me and caused more pain then anyone else in this world. Laslty, i just wanna know if any of you have good tips on how i can deal with this and what is your opinion on this situation. Oh and thank you guys so much for reading this and responding you don't know how much means to me :)",fxddak
Help. Please fast.,2,"Hey lads and lasses. So this is probably a really minor problem that I’m too stupid to fix. But here it goes. I have a really comfortable mattress and really warm duvets. But last night I couldn’t get to sleep until about 2 hours from when my dad sent me up to bed. I then woke up (now) and I jolted up instantly. I then for no reason walked into the bathroom and sat on the toilet. I got off and took a drink of water and when I left my head hurt and I was off balance. I don’t know what the hell is going on with my body. Please everyone help. Fast. I really need some sleep.

Edit:
If it’s any help:
• I’m below 15
• I sleep with my dog",fwx5y4
People leave me and I don't know why.,3,"It's a long one. Sorry for any typos. 

Okay, so here's my problem. All my life, friends would just leave me, with no explanation. 

One friend I had for 5 years, and who was a part of the family, and my mom loved her like a daughter, left me to hang out with a new girl who dated her brother at the time. I messaged her yesterday (about five years after we stopped hanging out) and told her everything that still bothered me after all those years, and she said it was all my fault and that I must be on drugs to write that stuff to her. I didn't reply to that because she does not deserve it. But she did leave. 

One girl, I really clicked with a year ago, (she is my boyfriend's sister's childhood friend) just stopped texting me or going out for coffee. I have no idea why. Maybe I should ask her, but I'm nervous about it. I don't want hee to assume that I'm clingy or something. 

One girl, for whom I thought was literary my soulmate, changed her attitude when I got a boyfriend. When we started hanging out, I didn't have a boyfriend, neither did she, and we spent every moment together. About 2 years after hanging out, I met my boyfriend. She was happy, she liked him. About 3 months into our relationship, when she realized we were serious, she changed her attitude. I realized something was wrong, but I didn't want to jump to any conclusions. Then I got a job in a city where he lived too, and it all changed. I called her every day after work, and she wouldn' t ask me how I was, how he was, she would just talk about herself. Then we had a huge fight where she said that we're both retarded and deserve each other, that our relationship sucks. We didn't speak for a month and kinda patched it up. Now we talk every 2-3 months, sometimes not even then. I miss her, but whenever I think about what she said to me and how I felt it makes me sick. 

I can't say that I didn't fuck up some of the other friendships I had, because I can't stand when people sneak behind my back or if they patronize me. I'm not perfect and I don't act like I am, but I believe that I didn't hurt nobody, at least not intentionally. 

I don't know what is it about me that makes people leave. Do you think there's something wrong with me?",fwi9uo

Father issues,3,"Hi I’m Henry and I’m 14, I’ll turn 15 later this month.
I get a pretty good amount of support from my friends and family and that’s wonderful. I really love everyone around me. 

Other than the other house I have to go to, my father is on surface level disrespectful to me, and is major subscribed to diet racism/misogyny. But when he and my mom were together he was mentally abusive and manipulative.

In recent years I’ve shown him I don’t like him and I’m cold with him, showing no interest and spending no extra time than I must with him.
But this past year I’ve developed what seems to be father issues. I’ve gotten attached to one of my male teachers, a simple compliment from him means the world to me. He’s the closest thing to a father I have in my life.

I don’t know how to get over this or fix this, I have this craving to just have some deep voiced man say I’m proud of you son.",fuqejk
Scammed out of money for a nintendo switch TWICE!,5,"I recently tried to buy a Nintendo switch of someone on Depop, this was through PayPal family and friends  and then I never received the switch and the person deleted the account which I later found out was hacked hence the hacker taking my money and deleting the account. 
I then tried to buy one off someone else on vinted. 
Vinted are a bit different where the money isn't released to the seller until I say that the item has been delivered.
This person wouldn't send unless they had the money so being as gullible as I am I released the money to them before they sent it, they have now also deleted their account and I have no proof of postage from either. 
It's pretty obvious I've been scammed and both PayPal and vinted say I can't get my money back. 

I'm with nationwide and I have submitted 2 visa disputes to them. 

I have argued profusely with both PayPal and vinted to get my money back and they said there's nothing I can do. 

Basically I'm asking if theres any likelihood I'll get my money back from the bank? 

I had no buyer protection with PayPal as it was family and friends bit vinted said my buyer protection was no longer valid because I released the money before getting the item. 

I'm out £260 ( basically enough to buy a brans new switch)  and I don't need any criticism from anyone as I already know how much of an idiot I've been to fall for this twice. 
I'm asking for advice and help.",ftvd6g
Should I be mad about my little sister getting things without trying while I have to work my butt off for things?,2,"sorry for bad grammar and spelling just wanted to rant about this problem I had that came out around an hour ago
Recently since the new ACNH switch came out I've been begging my parents to get me one and recently my little sister (8years old) suddenly wants it. I kept telling my parents a bunch of reasons why she shouldnt get it for example she broke her charger for her ipad around 4-5+ times last year and also had a replace/fix her ipad a couple times during that same year. I also told my parents I'd they do get her one they would be wasting $300 escpially if I'm correct you cant get warranty and you would have to buy another switch to replace.
So the real problem starts about an hour ago tonight. My sister and my grandma(I have a bad relationship with) talked about the ACNH switch and said to her she'll buy her one with her money tomorrow and told my dad. Over course being in the same room as mu dad I overheard their conversation and got really pissed about it. Since all my sister had todo was tell my grandma to buy her one. While I beg for my parents to try and get me one. What sucks even more is that all my devices like my laptop, games, and a switch(I wanted another one because I am a big fan of the game and the design)  I earned all of those with getting good grades and honor rolls. So I told my dad it was unfair and he said, "" it's your grandma's money and you should be happy for your sister"" And of course I'm pissed cause ik my grandma hates me and I hate her (more into that another time) and my grandma adores my sister.
A week before  I tried to give my sister my old 3ds and a few minutes later to get changed she fricking put my 3ds back on the table and told me it was ugly and wanted the switch. I got pissed because I gave her that 3ds so she could learn if she actually wants the switch or not because I have and also for just 1 game. 
Then yesterday she told my dad when he came home she didnt want the switch then I'm there all happy because I get a chance. Back to present day all the fucking sudden she wants it now.

Is wrong for me to get mad her and should I be happy for her instead?",fsxpxl
Feel free to read this!,8,"Okay so ....

I don't have a voice in my house,4,"My family is complicated to say the least. From an early point in my life my mom did abuse my sisters and I, which really made me a quiet person even to this day. I always feel like I don't have a voice in many situations, and most of the time I don't. If a disagreement happens between my sister and i, I would also get pieced out because I don't make money or have a job. Anyways I got out of that situation with my mom which was extremely taxing on me, and I moved in with my oldest sister, kia, around the age of 15 or 16, I'm 18 now. I can't thank my sister enough for what she has done but it comes with a few problems. My sister restricts so much from me and even my friends can see it too, for example before this corona stuff happened, I've had to babysit almost every week for multiple times a week, for multiple hours until midnight or so. I would get angry at her but not say anything about it because one time she threatened to kick me out of her house, and I have nowhere else to go. She says our family is a team, which I highly dislike because we're more than a team, we're a family. I also dislike this stigma because she treats me like I'm the worse person ever at times and I'm a good student and I'm respectful. She restricts my video game usage, which at first I understood and abided by. But now she's restricting it even more and I have no clue why. I did research on internet usage on games and electricity usage on games as well because it might be a financial thing. When I presented Kia with this information she told me she didn't care. Video games don't take up that many resources when compared to cable boxes or phones and honestly games helps me cope with alot of the mental problems that I have, and helps me actually become happy despite me overthinking, or not being sure of myself. She limited my entire wifi usage for my other sister, Quiana, and I for 4 shared hours. So school work, YouTube, phone usage, and game playing all have to fall between those four hours. I don't understand why she would implement this considering my sister's husband isn't even out of a job considering all of this corona stuff. The only enjoyment I've had so far is playing video games/watching anime for the short time I'm available to. At times like this sure my mom would beat me and whatnot but I wonder if she would limit my passions like Kia does. It really hurts because it's like her way of telling me ""I don't care about how you find your happiness."" The dream I set for myself is to be a gaming YouTuber funny enough, but knowing that my family knows this they just don't care about my passion for editing videos. It's really hard for me to speak up considering I was abused before and Kia dangles that over my head. For college I need a PC which I'm not asking for it here it's just needed for a film college I got accepted into and she expects me to ask my mom for it. I seriously hate my mom for the things she's done to me. Why would I talk to her? Why would I ask her for stuff like nothing's never happened?",fra83u

Parents that I believe are crazy,1,"Hey fellow Redditors, 
I don't know if my parents are exactly crazy but I needed to know so here it is. Btw I'm 17(f) a few months away from my 18th birthday.
Today I went to work in the morning from 7:00 to 14:00 and after that my father decided to be ""nice"" and ""allowed"" me to watch one online lesson today, two tomorrow before noon and one on Sunday, and then he told me that he expected me to go vacuum my room and wash all the bathrooms, sinks, and mirrors in the house before my mom got home. My mom comes home at 4 so I was a bit pressed on time but apparently she didn't mind that I didn't do what I was supposed to at first so my parents went to get groceries and left me at home and I decided to take a little break, when they came back my mom told me that I should continue relaxing and she went to clean the bathroom, sinks and mirrors herself. When I said that I already promised to do it and was going to in like half an hour she sarcastically said that it's fine and I should just ""continue not doing anything useful"" and then she added that ""it's not like you ever do anything useful"" then my grandfather came to the kitchen where I was sitting and yelled at me about how ungrateful I am and how I'm just wasting time and forcing my mom to do my work and that I always act selfishly like that. Then my father chimed in about how this is not the first time I have disregarded their wishes and ignored my chores. I was angry that they were all yelling at me but not really surprised because they do this almost every weekend exept my grandfather usually doesn't add to this conversation. Then I went and finished what was left and when I came back to the kitchen my father again emphasized that I should have done it as soon as I came back from work and how I should have known better than to delay it since I apparently do nothing useful all day.
I'm sorry for bothering you all but I need to know am I overreacting and am I really that horribly selfish and a horrible daughter.",fqccc5

What should i do? What should i feel?,1,"My question is below the backstory 

Backstory : I have been in many different relationships. I had girlfriends and i had boyfriends, yet i have never been as happy as with this one person. I met him few months ago and we instantly fell in love with each other. We saw it in each others' eyes. It was that shine and that emotion no words could have explained. Then came our relationship. We started off really quickly. We were very atracted to each other and we shared many emotions. We felt comfortable together. So comfortable that he was the first person i ever fully opened sexually to.
After few months of heaven i started to notice that he wasn't feeling as good as i did. We talked many nights and settled that he is afraid of geting into a serious relationship. 
I agreed on not calling it a relationship then, and not calling each others boyfriends. Next few weeks passed calmly but then the tough times came... Coronavirus has appeared and we got seperated by 350 miles. It wasn't the distance that concerned me.
The day he arrived home we talked on the phone, he sounded much happier than with me.
I asked him what he felt like - he said he felt free. 
He was feeling bad with commitment and got scared because of me stepping into his daily life.
Tonight we broke up.

I really love him. He loves me too.

I can't be in opened relationship which is his proposition. I am a romantic, emotional and delicate guy.

I don't know what to do or what to feel like. I would love to try being in this relation with him, because i am afraid of loosing him and yet again being alone. At the same time i am scared of being hurt because of this kind of relation.

Please... Help me",foizri

To add, I don't feel any connection to people, maybe that's why I don't care and don't want to congratulate. It sucks as hell.

I liked their course and how close it is so I applied for uni abroad which is like 2 hours by car ( yes I live close to border ) and it just sucks to hear that she just shoots down a thing that made me happy and hopeful. 


I tried to talk to her, calm her down but she dosent listen. She watched so many news and is terrified she locked herself in her house and sends her parents to do her shopping ( she is 22 ). I told her she should take necessary precautions but not to panic cause it won't do shit but everytime I share my opinion she just says I am not careful enough. 
It drives me nuts. Any advice? I asked her if she has some issues with me moving abroad even if it is still 2 hours by car from her. She has driving license but is too scared to drive.

My best friend is in love with me, has openly confessed it to me and wants to just give it a try and says that if it doesn't work out we'll stay friends but i dont believe it. 
He's a M26 and his behaviour is getting out of line, to the point where its bothering me but i cant say anything without hurting him. Also he's a classmate at college. Extra spicy 👌🏻

Another guy (M19) from school expressed his love for me, he's in the year above me. Told his entire class how in love he is with me and how amazing i am. Went out with him to a concert once, as friends. Then i couldnt get back due to the public transport, and i slept over at his place. He then told his whole class that we slept together but we didnt?! I had to turn him down 12 times..
Now after a month of silence he texted me again so i blocked him and hopefully he'll ignore me at school. Oh also my teachers got wind of that and my health counselor made me have a chat with her because of my behaviour around boys?! 
And that i wont be allowed on certain trips and projects if i didnt stop acting like i did. Mind you i didnt do anything that dude told his class a bunch of whack things and now its my fault?

Okay so i'm good friends with two brothers.
One is M20 and the other is M23, i do scouting with both of them and often after were done in the evening we go to their house for a drink.
Now with M23 we go to movies, sail a lot, just generally hang out etc. We're good friends. Now about a year and a half ago i asked him if he was into me because he was giving me vague signs. And at that point i wasnt into him or anything but i just needed to know. Now this week he came back from a trip to America for uni and we went to the movies and finally saw each other a lot again and he started to give 'the signs'. The classic putting his arm around me, pulling me in close, cuddling, annoying me by poking me in my side or booping my nose. But only when were alone.
Now outside of being the brother of one of my friends, hes a good friend of my ex. :'( 
Now i dont want to ask him AGAIN if hes into me?!

Also for all of you guys' clarity, i dont have an age gap issue, hence some of the guys mentioned are very much older than me. Also i live in Europe and the age of consent is 16.
My friends support my decisions but i feel like they are getting tired of all of my drama + most of the mentioned people my friends know and its embarrassing for the mentioned ones to just be openly outed as liking me, atleast in my opinion?

Also also, i'm currently doing an audio engineer study so its me and 20 other boys. Doesn't make life easier.

Maybe i'm just heavily self obsessed and think that everyone is just in love me

how my whole school goes against me,3,"so this is how it begins.

im currently grade 7 but this happened when i was grade 5. this guy, im gonna call him Luke. we always played soccer with other people in my class and every time i have the ball most of the time (as usual) someone would chase you to get the ball and every time he come for me, he always pushes me and after he done that a few times i kindly told him to stop. he kept on pushing me so i was yelling at him, i even told the teacher once and she/he (i dont remember) told Luke to stop, and he said he would stop but guess what.

he didn't.

i even went to the teacher's office to talk about it and she was talking like it meant nothing

and he continued

because this was my first problem with another student that physically touch me. i told my mom and it kind of went like this (since im to lazy to just tell it in details.):

Mom: yes OP?

me: Mom Luke kept on pushing me at school

Mom: srsly?? push him or punch him if he pushes you again

(mind you i've never hit someone ever since i was in school)

Me: okay..

he pushed me again and the one time i punch him he falls down crying and in my class Luke said he could beat me in a fight soo easily, almost my whole class heard and kept on telling me ""YOU!!?? OUT OF ALL PEOPLE YOU CAN BEAT HIM??? DONT MAKE ME LAUGH""

so yeah as soon as i punch him i go to the office and when i do i got to the principle's office. she looks at me with some sort of death glare and when i told her she told ME i had to go to stay in the office why me???

i still get mad about it today so yeah..

this is my first post so i might not be that good",fflrzv

Girls make no sense: Case example,2,"I'm a sophomore in high school and recently and because I'm not a loser I talk to girls, sometimes, it's not a challenge. However something terrible happened. In my math class, I was seated with 3 other girls in a table group of 4. 

I've sat with them for about 6 months now and every day my confusion and deep annoyance only grows. Initially I thought ""Hell yeah 3 girls this is pretty sweet."" However I was very wrong, it was not sweet at all. 

I had always heard of guys saying how troublesome and confusing girls where and how they couldn't understand their interests and stuff, but I always thought It was just the ""guy"" thing to do and you just kinda had to say you didn't get girls because you where a guy. Turns out I was wrong, kinda.

So we hit it off and our table group develops a friendly group dynamic. So we can be cordial but most the time we are harmlessly being mean to each other just because. However then things began getting weird. These females could just start talking about the boys they like and their relationships and what who said to whoever and other mind-bendingly boring stuff. They could talk for like 40 minutes about just garbage. I realized they where the exception because other girls don't ONLY talk about or as involved in melodrama as these girls do. 

Eventually the teacher kind of gave up on telling them to be quite and only does when she needs to address the class or lecture. Math comes very easily to me and the class goes slow because we have a stupid class, and also they're juniors who managed to fail the class and are repeating. The stupidest people get to set the pace for the whole class unfortunately. So besides studying the girls, I've done other productive things like learn more code, learn more spanish outside of spanish class, etc. 

Anyway that's kinda the context. So the females, they're like a whole other species, they have very different interests, senses of humor, etc. They say things that are totally not funny and laugh about it. I  know it works both ways but I just cannot understand them. 

Now to get specific. I'll start with the best girl. Daniella, she's a transfer student from Spain, she stayed for about 4 months until she had to unfortunately leave, she was smart and nice and her problems which where very similar to the other 2 girls problems where actually interesting. She was mad rich, she had a legit silver rolex and went to a private school. She only came here to learn english and get grounded.  Anyway she's gone but she was great, and it was really cool to hear about the lifestyle she lived.

Anyway the next caste

Ember, Katy, and Ashley

Ember and Katy are both your normal gossipy blonde bitchy girls. Both just talk about boys and makeup and cliche girl stuff. 

Ashley was Daniella's replacement. I was very unsure about her, I was sad to see Daniella get replaced the day after she left. But it turned out Ashley was actually not so bad. She was similar to the other two in that she also was gossipy but she was emotionally and socially smarter. She was also very introspective. Weirdly, she extremely bad at math, even though I considered her the smartest of the girls. 

Anyway Ember made probably the least sense. She had this hearing aid she always wore. I kept telling her it's dangerous because now the government has complete control over one of her senses, and what If someone hacked into it? She would also wear these massive hoop earrings. I hated them. Anytime she wore them I would tell her how goofy they where and how they made no sense. I could fit my head through them. And for her own safety they need to be removed. She never listens to my advice though, I kept on telling her how if she gets near a powerful magnet they are going to tear her ear. 

Ember has been my main concern. She's the most hopeless. Katy is the most bitchy and puts on the ""tough delinquent girl"" act the strongest. But she is the most academic of the girls. She's not terrible if you get to know her.

Ember however is very stupid. One day, she decided to unlearn the rules of basic math. All of a sudden, she didn't understand how negatives worked. She thought a negative minus a negative would result in a more negative number, which it doesn't. However she somehow reached this understanding and had such extreme confidence in it that it was impossible to change her mind without getting the teacher behind me. 

That's when I realized I had to help her with tough love. I so began calling her stupid every chance I got. My hope was she would realize that she is, in fact, stupid. This way at least when she says something stupid, she won't do it with such confidence. Or maybe, after she realizes she's stupid, she will gain the ability to think about the things she says, and hopefully think something like ""oh wait, I need to remember how dumb I am, maybe I should reconsider if what I'm saying is right or if I should say it at all?"" 

Unfortunately I got tired of my efforts going unappreciated, so I stopped. They were also being very mean to me in response, even after I explained my motivations. 

Nothing major has happened recently. I am looking for new soft skills to learn while in class. I need a use for my time.",fevkvz

And maybe, just maybe, I'll solve it for you!",fczzfk
Wrong place,2,"Well, sorry if that post is long. I got nobody to talk about this and I don't speak english well so I'll try my best since I'm belgian.

Everything begun when I was 4 years old, my dad work in the navy and was often at the other side of the world for his job. My mother work in a restaurant company that have a lot of restaurant in my country so we didn't had a lack of money to live, my sister and I had a lot of present every weeks so we played a lot together. I loved my sister a lot as her big brother and I even learned her to walk (she's two years younger than me).
But everything wasn't always pink, my sister and I are different from other people since we've the Asperger's syndrome (a form of autism). That make that we've a lot of difficulty to understand the other humans and can learn very fast when we want to, our dad has the same thing than us and he knew that we were like him when we were young. So he bring us by people who are specialised with child like us to know how to manage us but our mother weren't okay with that because she wanted that we had a ""normal"" and happy life. My sister and I were diagnosed with the Asperger's syndrome and so we passed some test to know at wich point it was.

Me at 4 years old I had an IQ of 130, my sister at 2 years old 140. She already could speak and do math and had a complete photographic memory. 

Our parents discussed about these results, our dad was very happy and wanted to put us in an specialised school but our mother was a bit horryfied at the tought that we would only study without experimenting a normal life. So our dad put my sister and I in an school with other child of our age but with an experimental program that learned us an foreign language very young. At the age of 5 we had a test to enter the next phase of the program and my father sing me in without my mother knowing it. 

When they got the letter saying that I wasn't accepted because of my hyperactivity even if I had the best scotes my dad phoned to the director of the program and said that the exam wasn't staying an hour on a chair but it was answering questions in different topics in an foreign language. After a few minuts discussing I was accepted. My mother couldn't stand that our dad was putting us in an experimental program like laboratory mices so they divorced but my sister and I entered the program.

I entered in elementary school, all my lessons were in Dutch except the French lesson. The other child in my class were all ""normal"", they weren't ""special"" like me so they learned slowly compared to me and when you're so young you're an alien for the others. 
If you wanted something you had to ask it in dutch even if we hadn't learned the vocabulary yet and the program was tough so we had pretty none vocabulary the first 3 years. And it so that an accident that began the real nightmare happened. I needed to go to toilet but i forgot how to say it, I was 6 years old, hypercative so I wasn't listening a lot in class and the teacher was very strict with me because she knew how I was.
Two hours later, i remembered how to say it. I stood up and walked to the teacher but in the middle of the class it was too much and I pee on myself. Everybody was laughing about me and saying that the alien leaked in the middle of the class. The next day the whole school knew it and at the midtime pause during the lunch some people 5 years above me made me dink pee making me believe that it was apple juice.
It was so that I started being bullied because I'm ""different"". In the beginning I tought that it was only little jokes that was normal between peoples (I knew nothing about social and it was really hard to me to understand, even now I'll turn 20 this summer and I have struggles to communicate).
I lived one week with my mother and the other week with my father, they hated each other and my sister and I, we needed to handle it (insults, manipulation,...). My sister weren't aware of what it was because I protected her as much as possible. She was my little world of purity and cuteness. Always smiling, fragile and pure. A lovely little sister with blue/grey eyes and blond hairs. 
Since she was victim of a rape... I failed.. I couldn't protect her, my dad was on a boat far away and my mother weren't home.. 
Since this day she lost her smile a bit more everyday, her eyes became like mine, completely grey and her hairs became more brown.
She isolated her, played less and less with me. Keeping the secret of her rape during years.
Since that happen I became more and more aware of the world around me, how people (even adults) treated me like an alien or a genius. I learned that well when I had an accident and needed a surgery that was 8 hours long or I couldn't walk anymore. Gracefully this accident also happened when my dad was in mission so the army paid the best surgeons to opperate me  because they were responsible for my security when my dad was in mission.
The years passed and the situation got worse. My dad and mother became alcoholic because my sister talked about her rape. My dad couldn't find a stable relationship and so living with him became like managing a child when you're 8.
I got bullied from my 6 years old to my 15 years old. I couldn't get out of the experimental program since I was too precious with my results so I was forced to stay with my bullyers until the end of my scholarship.
I became depressed at 9, went to the psychologist for 4 years but nothing worked and I made 2 psychologist depressed so nobody wanted to listen to me since I was a ""special case of young child with the maturity of an old man"". Some people even said of me that it was like I made the world war when I talked. 

My dad said me horrible things, that I was responsible of all his problems. That my behavior bringed all the problems that destroyed him. My mother was more gentle with me and managed everything so that I could have a better life, enjoying a bit my child life. For that I'm going to thank her forever.
But that didn't last long.
When I was 10 my dad met a women that had 4 girls. I lived a constant nightmare during 5 years. It was so hard to live that I tried twice to kill myself bit the both times I stopped right before I died because I tought that I must stay alive for my mom and my sister. I forced my sister to live exclusively by my mom and managed to make a trial against my father to live by my mom except for 2 weekends a month and the half of the holydays. 
Between my 15 and 18th anniversary a lot of things happened. Since I lost my virginity when I was 12 a lot of my """"""""""friends"""""""""" asked my help to have girlfriends or how to begin a sexual life without too much problems and how to handle it. I became to get integrate in the class and made my first real friendly relationships (at least I tought) so I learned psychology and how to handle friends. 
I begun to teach lessons after the school in an class near the study room of the school during 2 years, I helped as much as possible everyone who didn't understood something and I even went to some of them's houses around 10PM the days before exams to help them. I managed this, I listenned to their problems sometimes late in the night and helped them to solve it, I litteraly carried 20 lifes that were for me nothing but simple compared to mine and one day I fell on the ground after my day at school. I went back home, said ""Hi mom! How was your day?"" (I didn't saw her a llt because at this moment she worked 60 hours a week because we were 4 to live in the house and life became extremely expensive) and I fell appart. I made a burn-out when I was 16 years old. I stopped teaching in the classroom after the school and helped only one girl with teaching because I knew that without me she wouldn't pass her exams. (Actually she's studying to become social worker because I inspired her.)
After this my depression got worse and worse because my mother didn't stand under the pressure of her work and became more and more alcoholic.
My father's mind fell apart so I went back by him to help him. I graduated from the experimental program and my mother met her first love back. We moved out (I moved out at least 8 times during my life actually) by his house and I tried university in biology...

I think that life want me to suffer because I fell in love with a girl that was perfect, she listenned to my and the story of my life, I listenned to her and we got in couple. In december 2018 my grandfather had an cerebrovascular accident right before christmas and my exams in january. I move by my father because he lived closer to the University and so I could sleep more than 4 hours per night. Even tough i studied as I could but don't passed any exams. 3 month later my girlfriend lost two of her grand parents and by my side my father tried to kill himself, I arrived in time to stop him and he went to the hospital. I lived alone in a big house for 2 month, it was hard with the pressure of the university, my girlfriend depressed with the lost of their grand parents and my father in the hospital after an attempt to kill himself. The result: I said something horrible without noticing it directly and didn't erase the message at time (on messenger) so she broke with me right before the exams in july... I passed 2 exams on the 9. I was close for some of them with 9.8/20 but I was too tired.. Exhausted of this life and I said fuck off to the university. I had nobody to help me, I was and am alone since I'm born. Without anybody to try to understand me. I'm now learning in computing and programming since I think like a computer. A couple of days ago I lost my grandfather, he finally died after 2 years of dying slowly in the hospital. Everytimes saying to me that he suffer. My dad is always alcoholic, my mom have a better life since I left her home so I don't want to bother her with my problems (I already tried and it was catastrophic). My best-friend has his problems and I can't ask him help. My sister is rebuilding herself slightly. And me I'm carrying my whole family even if I'm completely broken in pieces. I can't cry anymore even if I want or need it. A lot of things have the taste of blood, my vision often goes dark and nothing brings me fun. I'm bored constantly. 

Here I resumed my life, I didn't tell everything. It would take a lot of time. Too much time.

If you read this thank you, it already helped me a bit. At least I hope it because I'm so stressed and depressed that I lost sleep years ago. 

This world sucks, I've been born in the wrong time or in the wrong world. I don't enjoy anything anymore and sometimes I get lost in my dreams of another world where I can finally feel peace in my heart and mind. That's the last thing that make me cry..

My Experiences When Shopping,3,"I hope I found the right thread :/

I would just like to say I'm capable of going shopping by myself. When ever I go to jbhifi the person who I often spoke to wasn't too rude. Some employees are straight up rude and unhelpful, but it was the fact that they seemed to know me and when ever I go to tweed city jbhifi they always give me a stare and act like I'm a f$cking criminal. Not to long ago when I went to jbhifi to grab something... can't remember what it was, one of the dudes there asked where my parents were. Like wtf, C$$t I'm 17 nearly 18 I don't need a parent by my side to do basic shopping, like where's your friendly employee attitude. This happens all the time with other things like not giving a clear explanation on a particular product and such... keep in mind I'm friendly to them always. In fact I don't go shopping really at all. The only time I go shopping is when I wanna get myself something legendary, or rarely go with my mum or dad or just with mates.
I don't hate going out but when someone takes control of me to do basic necessities it really pisses me off. Some stores have this problem but I'll keep it short.",fc8kvh

"Help, my teeth hurt!!",1,"So, I woke up in the morning, having a smoked sausage and eggs, I ate some pineapple and it was cold, so my teeth began to hurt and I was about to scream in pain when this happened.",fbw0w6
I Had a fight with my dad,4,"Let me lay it out for you all. I am 24 still living at home with my parents still looking for work. Been on and off jobs for the last year not in a financial position to move out yet. Want to be a full time writer and been doing well to build up a following, been working on my craft and decided to go to uni, starting this year. 
Considering i pay rent agreed between my father and I, and pay for my own rego, insurance, clothes, things i want or need, the only thing my rent contributes is food, electricity and water. I help around the house, do what needs to be done and apply for jobs still. He believes he can dictate what i can and can't do because i am in his words living under his roof and his word is always law. I believe that no longer applies to modern times. It is my house just as it is my siblings, my mums and his.
My dad, he's a boomer, doesn't believe you have to apply online, goes with '""call them up or walk in to speak with manager or call after the interview and do a follow up."" Thinks I have to be out of the house, believes that i should no longer be here cause of my age. I am in his eyes a financial burden.
Now my sister, she's a full time uni student learning to be a dr. She turns 20 this year, doesn't pay rent, rego, insurance, all of that is covered by dad as he agreed to do so and stated he would have done the same if i went into uni straight from highschool. My parents run a business and my sister works the small hrs she is given and hold tight onto that money. Spending it more on her GF than anything. 
All of this is frustrating as dad doesn't approve with my choice to be a writer. He doesn't approve of the course i had chosen, he's not supportive of anything i do, and throws back in my face that he helped me get jobs and how i should be thanking him and blaming me for cocking it up. I gave them my best, many admired that i got up everyday and go to work despite the bullying that went on and still he deemed as ""she could have done better.""
The argument: I clapped back at my dad, trying to lecture me on how to be an adult, how i should work like him because he chose to buy a business and do shit for it, he hates that i have free time and tries to offload more things onto me when there is no need. I have three younger siblings who do less than me. Says he's the only one with a job yet my mum runs the business from home. Stated my sister doesn't pay rent i and i do, as well with rego and insurance and she doesnt pay a cent. Telling me i should get a job, yet i have been applying for months, tell me to move out and so i throw back why i should, putting my foot down telling him he does not dictate my life or my sisters lives and that i do what needs to be done in the house, pay for rent and help when its needed, therefore he shouldn't have a say about anything i do.
In the end he says I'm going to get a rude shock and found out later he plans to make me pay for a sixth of everything. I'm not going to let it happen.
I am sorry for the long post but i wanted to tell someone. Its the first time where i have stood up for myself as my father has been controlling of me for a very long time.",fblmhv
I haven't got any new message from my best friend.. What can I do?,3,Last night I was texting my best friend on messenger and she didn't answer me at all and I got very sad about this and I was crying. Since in 2017 I've been there with her at bridge school.,fb762z
I messed up so bad......,2,"This time every year low income Americans- with children- get another chance. They get a large lump sum from the government and take care of everything they have been running from since all year and get themselves up to an almost comfortable financial position. I work hard and look forward to my income tax return to give me a boost and help me make ends meet. To buy new furniture or to take my kids on a move little trip or a few outings.   I have done this every year for ten years. I work hard, always have. Last year we planned a big move out of the city and into the Midwest We took my family away from the hell that is south philly to a nice, large, comfortable home in the Midwest so I could be with the family I left behind in 1998. 
I knew the year would be hard, but my family needed the move. I barely grazed the $25,000 mark and I pushed off every bill I could push off.  We underestimated how much a cross country move would cost and we also underestimated how much it would cost to furnish a house 5 times the size of our little row home in Philly. We exhausted every cent of our savings and started skipping what bills we could put off until the highly anticipated time: Income tax refund time. Among those bills that got pushed off were my the dreaded student loan bills. 
Now, the most ironic part about me owing student loans is I have narcolepsy, so I have attempted college 6 times. I tried so hard and failed out every single time. The most recent time was with Grand Canyon University. For substance abuse and addiction studies. They would send me large refund checks $1500-$2000 at a time, four checks to be exact. I made straight A’s and at 62% completion I failed a math class. They charged me $1900 for the class – of which they had already sent me via a check and told me if I did not pay it, I could not finish classes, nor could I claim any of the classes I had taken and passed. I still had nothing to show for what I had done even though I worked so hard and did so well. I went through all the steps to get my loans discharged due to my narcolepsy being so severe and I gave up on college altogether. I took yet another low paying job and I work evenings and weekends to show them I am serious about the position in hopes of getting a raise at my 1-year mark. 
The student loans dropped off my credit report back in October and I thought I was safe to go ahead, and file taxes and I started making plans for the $6,628 that I was supposed to receive. I had it all planned out. I was going to use $2500 of it to catch up on bills (I have a $600 gas bill that is waiting and we are already behind one month on the mortgage, I also have about $500 in credit card payments that are just days away from going into collections and smashing my already low credit), $800 to get my incapacitated mother from the nursing home in Philadelphia where I left her, $300 for my sons birthday, $300 for Easter, $200 for each little boy and a spring/summer wardrobe. I signed them up for baseball and summer camp and they are waiting to be paid. I never got an offset notice form in the mail. They said they mailed it to my Philadelphia address. The student loan website says my loans defaulted in December 2019. I thought surely, they would garnish my wages first or maybe take half my income tax refund this year half next. I was already low income; my kids’ father is on childhood disability and even has a nighttime gig working under the table. I thought – “there is no way they can take it all. It is my lifeline. I need it. My kids need it. 

Sure, enough I check the “where’s my refund” website when it was a week late and it gave me the news. ""Your refund has been partially or totally taken in the amount of 6,628 to pay a federal debt"". I called the offset line and they gave me the news. Your refund has been offset in the amount of $6,628. I cried and threw up at the same time. I have heard of this happening to people. I knew it was a possibility. I know there are so many people who know what a large amount $6,628 is and how life changing it can be.  The gas will be shut off, the car up for repo, my kids won’t be able to go to camp, all my debts will be sent into collections. My mother will stay in Philadelphia where no one talks to her because she can’t talk back, where she has to have strangers give her baths and she never sees one familiar face. 

My 8-year-old went to school in pants that were size 5T today and I gave up all hope. Now dragging myself out of bed is a struggle I have let my family down; I have taken money right from their mouth. All because I wanted to go to stupid college to possibly do better for them. I should have known better the to try. I should have known better then to take the money Grand Canyon university was sending me because I should have known I would never complete a degree program to its entirety. 

People will tell you that money can’t buy happiness that life is more than just money. Well, coming from a low wage earner and a mother of a low-income family having my bills paid would make me very happy. Having a credit score above 500 would make me happy. My 8-year-old not going to school in pants that are size 5T would make me incredibly happy. Getting my mother home to the family who loves her and seeing her meet her great grand children for the first time would make me happy. $6,628 is a huge amount of money to someone like me and I don’t know how to get my life in order without it. I have no options. My $800 pay checks every two weeks are nothing. I feel like not even going back to my stupid job what is the point? I am replaceable anyway.  I make mistakes and I am not even that nice to people. I have a budget all planned and I thought to myself …… If I can just catch up.

 With my tax money I will catch up and I will be in a better place. It was a lie. A joke and the government decided to take it to pay a debt probably because they knew I was discharging the loan due to a disability and they wanted to take it while they could get it. I am lost. I feel like crawling into bed and never getting out. If I had money to buy something to help me die I probably would. My life is to far in shambles to get it back. Might as well not even be here. Now tell me money can’t buy happiness because it sure as shit could buy mine",fb68at
