Work problems...,7,"So I work at an elementary school through Americorps right? When the schools closed down, the principal (one of my bosses) asked me to check in every day with the vice-principal, Minh. I asked if we could make it a weekly check-in but the vice principal said since principal said we gotta do every day, it's what I have to do.

Well, I did forget some days of the week to check-in. And so my Americorps Supervisor calls me to yell (rant) at me for it.

She's been very inconsistent with the requirements with this whole check-in even though I'm checking in with just the vice principal and not her. Our check-ins are separate. Mind you her job is to make sure I'm doing my job at the school which is why shes concerned with the check-in between me and the vice principal.

In April, since I forgot a couple more days, she called again. And ranted over and over how I'm not professional and even threatening to fire me because I'm being so unprofessional for not checking in with the vice principal. She told me she doesn't care what time I check in just as long as I do it? Since my work at home hrs have been so...all over the place.

Technically it was our Spring Break when I forgot that time so I didn't it was such a big deal.

Well, today she called (EVEN THOUGH I HAVE CHECKED IN every day) and RANTED OVER AND OVER how so I'm so unprofessional and how my check-in times are so late. I asked her what time does she want me to check-in? And I didn't get a specific time. So I send my daily check in to vice-principal and say ill be checking in at 1 pm every day. Then she texts me and says ""NO the requirement is 12:00pm""

She's being very inconsistent with her requirements and expectations and I'm getting sick of her threatening to fire me over this stupid check-in.

Hearing someone call you unreliable, unaccountable, unprofessional, etc. over and over. I cried during our call but I muted it bc I was trying so hard to stay professional.

She said she will not be my reference for whatever job I may be getting next...mind you, I never asked her to.

I don't know what to do. I want to report this to her boss and talk to my vice principal but I don't how to explain it to them.

Thank you for reading this whole thing...I really could use some professional advice on this if there is anything I can do.",g2x57f
I'm stuck in another country with my mom and step-father who apparently can't stop fighting each other,13,"Hi

Well, I'm originally from South America, I live there with my dad. This February I had to come to Europe, where I lived in for seven years before I went back to my country, so I could help my mom take care of my little brothers until she recovered from a serious surgery. My step-father and her are separated, he usually stays in another city because of work and then comes to the city my mom lives in for two weeks so he can see the kids. That's all good, it works for them, but quarantine messed things up, since my step-dad can't go back to the city. My mom and him fight absolutely all the time, sometimes it's over serious problems and sometimes over really small things. It has been like this since I was 13 years old (I'm currently 21), that's why they separated.

The thing is, all of this is taking a toll on my mental health and I haven't been able to go back to my country. The embassy and airline won't answer my emails. I'm getting sick of it, plus I'm starting online classes.

I don't know how I will manage to stay sane. I've tried talking to them calmly, yelling, putting on my headphones on full volume so I can't hear them, going to another room but it doesn't work since the apartment is tiny and I don't have a bedroom for myself.

What can I possibly do? I'm genuinely desperate.",g2oc25
Online school (not serious),5,"This is very mild, and will probably make me sound bratty, but here we go. I had a science project I had to hand in, and usually my teacher would pester us to hand in every part of the assignment (understandably). But because of online school, I forgot to. I handed in the main assignment, but forgot all my research notes. What’s stranger is that I handed in the works cited on a separate page, but had no notes attached.

"im fat, depressed and tired and imma blame it on the lockdown :)",9,"ok so this quarantine has completely fucked me over

&#x200B;

i started out with the intent to exercise, but due to my extreme procrastination that plan has been completely flushed, and i (believe i) have packed on a decent amount of fat that wasnt there beforehand. on top of this, i have insomnia, and i never take sleeping pills as they leave me with a migraine, so if i do sleep, its 4am or later. my body seems to have calibrated itself to wake up at 3pm because of this, giving me no time to do ANYTHING.

so, i need either ways to motivate myself, or very easy and quick workouts, and ways to sleep without pills.

any tips? honestly im open to try anything right now. hell, ill even try home remedies.",g26zrr

i started out with the intent to exercise, but due to my extreme procrastination that plan has been completely flushed, and i (believe i) have packed on a decent amount of fat that wasnt there beforehand. on top of this, i have insomnia, and i never take sleeping pills as they leave me with a migraine, so if i do sleep, its 4am or later. my body seems to have calibrated itself to wake up at 3pm because of this, giving me no time to do ANYTHING.

so, i need either ways to motivate myself, or very easy and quick workouts, and ways to sleep without pills.

any tips? honestly im open to try anything right now. hell, ill even try home remedies.",g26zrr

Work problems...,8,"So I work at an elementary school through Americorps right? When the schools closed down, the principal (one of my bosses) asked me to check in every day with the vice-principal, Minh. I asked if we could make it a weekly check-in but the vice principal said since principal said we gotta do every day, it's what I have to do.

Well, I did forget some days of the week to check-in. And so my Americorps Supervisor calls me to yell (rant) at me for it.

She's been very inconsistent with the requirements with this whole check-in even though I'm checking in with just the vice principal and not her. Our check-ins are separate. Mind you her job is to make sure I'm doing my job at the school which is why shes concerned with the check-in between me and the vice principal.

In April, since I forgot a couple more days, she called again. And ranted over and over how I'm not professional and even threatening to fire me because I'm being so unprofessional for not checking in with the vice principal. She told me she doesn't care what time I check in just as long as I do it? Since my work at home hrs have been so...all over the place.

Technically it was our Spring Break when I forgot that time so I didn't it was such a big deal.

Well, today she called (EVEN THOUGH I HAVE CHECKED IN every day) and RANTED OVER AND OVER how so I'm so unprofessional and how my check-in times are so late. I asked her what time does she want me to check-in? And I didn't get a specific time. So I send my daily check in to vice-principal and say ill be checking in at 1 pm every day. Then she texts me and says ""NO the requirement is 12:00pm""

She's being very inconsistent with her requirements and expectations and I'm getting sick of her threatening to fire me over this stupid check-in.

Hearing someone call you unreliable, unaccountable, unprofessional, etc. over and over. I cried during our call but I muted it bc I was trying so hard to stay professional.

She said she will not be my reference for whatever job I may be getting next...mind you, I never asked her to.

I don't know what to do. I want to report this to her boss and talk to my vice principal but I don't how to explain it to them.

I'm stuck in another country with my mom and step-father who apparently can't stop fighting each other,13,"Hi

Well, I'm originally from South America, I live there with my dad. This February I had to come to Europe, where I lived in for seven years before I went back to my country, so I could help my mom take care of my little brothers until she recovered from a serious surgery. My step-father and her are separated, he usually stays in another city because of work and then comes to the city my mom lives in for two weeks so he can see the kids. That's all good, it works for them, but quarantine messed things up, since my step-dad can't go back to the city. My mom and him fight absolutely all the time, sometimes it's over serious problems and sometimes over really small things. It has been like this since I was 13 years old (I'm currently 21), that's why they separated.

The thing is, all of this is taking a toll on my mental health and I haven't been able to go back to my country. The embassy and airline won't answer my emails. I'm getting sick of it, plus I'm starting online classes.

I don't know how I will manage to stay sane. I've tried talking to them calmly, yelling, putting on my headphones on full volume so I can't hear them, going to another room but it doesn't work since the apartment is tiny and I don't have a bedroom for myself.

What can I possibly do? I'm genuinely desperate.",g2oc25
Online school (not serious),6,"This is very mild, and will probably make me sound bratty, but here we go.
