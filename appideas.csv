A way to make android gaming controls more usable and similar to console.,0,"Is there a way to use the movement of your device to trigger onscreen buttons? Let's say you are playing an emulator and the original console controls required the use of 4 different inputs at once. Two thumbs and then a finger on each trigger. Many games use controls like this, and it's why playing shooters on the phone feels so clunky. When using on screen controls you can only use your two thumbs thus making it uncomfortable to properly play. For example take Minecraft. You look and move around with the joysticks, then attack or place blocks with the triggers, enabling you to simulataniously move whilst interacting. This is a critical factor in immersiveness and general playability of the gaming experience. When your control inputs are limited as they are on touchscreen devices, it forces games to adapt and change, often making console ports hard to enjoy, however creating an interesting variety of unique controls for other games that perhaps were originally designed around this flaw.

Specifically targeting emulators and console ports; games not designed around this flaw in controls, in my opinion this side of things could really do with a way of getting around this problem as it would vastly improve the enjoyability of playing (proper) games on the phone. My solution involves using the accelerometer & gyroscope to detect when the phone was being tapped on the top corners or back, and then mapping these input signals to control a touch button on the display, thus creating artificial trigger buttons for your emulator's.

You would simply hold the phone in a landscape position in a similar way to how you would hold a regular gaming controller, with your fingers resting on the top left and right corners of the screen. Just give them a good tap and that's your button. Surely the phones sensors are sensitive enough for that to be enough to trigger an onscreen reaction. Granted, this would not be a perfect solution as it would only really allow you to tap the triggers and not hold them down, however this could surely be somewhat mitigated by using a combination of all of your phones sensors to detect a purposeful input. The microphone would be able to detect a sound transient upon contact, as well as your gyroscope detecting subtle movements in orientation. Perhaps an extremely subtle flick of the phone toward whichever trigger you wish to press, in conjunction with the tap detected by the microphone, would be the best way to grant this method consistentcy as well as true functionality, via the added support of several sensors working together to detect intentional input.

Would this work, and is it already simple and easy to do with apps currently available?",rbs5ja

An App to Organize an Event with complete Strangers,5,"**Minimal Scope of the MVP**

An App that lets user organize or start an event that anyone (a complete stranger) can join. There would be different types of event that can be organized like travel, party, dinner, art exhibit, youtube collab, sports/game, mass gathering, ""for-a-cause"" events and etc. Each type of event will have its own features like for example in a Travel event, an organizer can setup the itineraries, the travel rules, number of participants, contributions/memberships and etc. User can be an ""Organizer"" or a ""Goer"" and their account will have a profile on each type in which they can have their own timeline to post the events they organized or they participated. In each event (as a whole) the goers can rate it like ""it was a flop"", ""I somehow enjoyed it"", ""best experience or it's a blast"" something like that and they can also leave a review in it. Also, the Goers can give ratings and feedback/review to the Organizer on how he/she organized the event as a whole. In addition, depending on an event type (Travel for example) Goers can also give ratings and feedbacks to their fellow Goers. Meaning, they can leave their stories/experiences with their co-Goers as to what kind of event buddy he/she is.

**The Catch**

Now here's the catch, the Goers will not be revealed upon joining. Meaning, they are completely anonymous until they will see each other in the event proper (let me know if this is cool or a dumb feature). This is to avoid different discriminations. As long as the Goer agrees to the rules the organizer has specified and can afford the contributions or expenses of the event, then whatever her/his physical, spiritual or any kind or personal attributes will not be a hindrance from joining an event. Only the Backoffice (admin) will have the Goers and Organizers identity revealed since we plan to avoid fake events and participants. Before a user can create or join an event, the user must be identity verified first in the backoffice (personal data will be private of course).

**Scalability and Marketability**

In my mind I know it would be scalable and marketable since this app plans also to cater reservation systems that can be proposed to establishment owners to include their businesses in the app. Meaning, they will only register their businesses and the will have a panel to handle the reservations. We can also put an ""event commissions"" on events created for a profit. We will also secure the participant's contribution by escrowing it. Meaning, we can only release the contributed amount only if the event is already done. In this feature, an organizer must ensure to cater own event expenses first and will not depend on the contributions. But of course the organizer can view the total event contributions in real-time (if needed). For now, these are the only things that's popping in my head. But I know this can be a huge thing if properly realized.

**Development**

I am a Sr. Developer myself. I have 7 years experience in developing SaaS, Websites and Mobile Apps for different projects. I will create the wireframes of the MVP to start the project.  I only have this idea in my mind and anyone might be interested to collab (in anyway to be a partner), we can further discuss this idea. Just let me know.

Let me know what you think about this App Idea if it's a blast or a flop. Thanks!",ra21of

Not just any other dating app..,0,"💡Got another app idea, not sure if it’s a thing or not:

A dating app where people leave reviews of you after having dated you (probably should only keep the most recent 3 years or something). Potential prospects could pay more for x-rated details like good/bad in bed (with a summary or detailed passage explanation). You get to rate with stars and you’ll have a rank of 1-5 stars as well as a recommend/wouldn’t recommend dating. Reviews would be kept anonymous. The details would be up to the individual as that’s your choice what you’re willing to share as it could potentially expose who you are.

An app that tells you when an NSFW scene is coming up in a movie.,16,"Here me out right, you in a theater watching a P13 or R rated movie with your parents and BOOM a big 45 and half second, full on nude, rough sex scene with loud moaning comes on and catches you off guard.

What now, you have to sit there, awkward as hell, with a possible boner and wait it out while your parents are right next to you and your dad bumps you on the shoulder saying ""you like it, don't you 😏"" OK maybe not the last part haha. But still.

This app would be the ultimate life saver called ""NSFW Saver""

So you click on the movie, time you are watching it and the app will vibrate in a certain pattern to distinguish it from a regular notification. That will let you know what's good what's good, you should leave to the bathroom now or where you want to go. Then the app will vibrate when that scene is over, so you can go back to your seat.

Yes there may be more then one NSFW scene. So your parents may question

""Why you're going to the bathroom so many times during the movie?""

""Uh... I'm very gassy.""

Or

""You seem to have left the theater at the exact times that a sex scene was going to happen....""

""I don't know.... uh coincidence I guess.""",r8fzf8

App that shows how other people would say something:,2,"Almost constantly we hear people respond with boring phrases such as “that’s so cool”, “wow- really” and “not much, you?”. The truth is, this type of dialog is boring and adds nearly nothing to a convo. Most people, even if they’re interested in the conversation, can lack the creativity to say a tailor made reply. 

     That is where this app would help change that. A vocabulary of words is no good if they can’t be arranged into a vocabulary of phrases. People will often lack a reply and resort to something they say frequently, then ask themselves: “How else could I have said that?” 

     This has the potential be a very good network app- if designed correctly. My vision would be a simplistic and minimalist “Reddit” style chat room, where a phrase or question can be posted between quotations. Other users can then post on the phrase how they would say the phrase in they’re own words. 

     Posting responses will give a string of comments in order of the best user rated synonymous phrase. Any question, phrase or one-liner could be posted, helping people improve their vocabulary of things to say daily during conversation.",rf53e7

Collective Bargaining For Prescription Medications / Improve Med Prices,3,"Medication prices are increasing to levels that are not sustainable.  In an ideal world, people come together and negotiate the best prices.  Insurances should be that vehicle and should negotiate better prices for its customers.

But with the current legislation and the allowance of rebates, coupon cards, pharmacy benefit managers, and hidden prices from the end customers, patients are actually seeing higher prices with their insurance copays than what they would pay for if they just paid cash.  Many times people don't know this either (lack of price transparency).  Now this isn't always the case and is dependent on one's insurance plan but this is becoming more of an issue as more people are being pushed into high deductible insurance plans.

My app idea would be for individuals to collectively group together and to purchase mail order prescription medications.

* Groups of patients would join together by prescription medication with individual unit requests (ex: 4 novolog insulin pens)
* Prescriptions would be verified by their physician.
* Pharmacies and/or manufacturers (only licensed and registered medication distributers allowed) would bid on servicing the group's orders - like a tendering for the orders.
* A ""reverse auction"" at regular intervals (ex: every 2 weeks or once a month, depending on demand) would occur where the pharmacy with the lowest bidding price wins servicing the orders. The orders would be mailed to the customers and patients can fill their prescriptions.

Initial Pros/Cons:

* Patients may have to wait longer for their orders to be processed but this would group customers together to collectively bargain for the best prices. If they need the medications sooner, a local pharmacy in today's traditional model can service them better.
* This makes sense for patients who need **scheduled** medications for **long** periods of time. A medication that is of short duration or an urgent need would be better serviced at an individual's local pharmacy
* This would allow individuals to get the cheapest cash prices and even be able to go back to their insurance and submit a claim for coverage, although coverage would ultimately be determined by their insurance and may be denied. In that case, the patient is not using their insurance (or contributing to their deductible) like GoodRx's model.
* This would expose hidden prices of medications and increase transparency to customers and the marketplace.

Request: iOS app that allows you to use iPhone or iPad as Sony Camera monitor through lightning cable,1,"We invest a lot of money in our Sony cameras at all professional tiers, from the under $1,000 mirror less cameras to the big sensor cinema cameras. We also invest a lot of money into our phones and tablets. Then, we spend more to purchase monitors (the ones that attach to your camera, not your computer) that we can use in various ways with our cameras.

The hardware in our iPhones and iPads are more than enough to handle anything a professional monitor could do and even has editing apps that have a lot of the simple editing features that simple videos that only need, like Adobe rush or even iMovie. 

In addition, the ability to use the iOS device as an SSD would be amazing too, as it would cut down on a lot of extra steps in workflow and create instant iCloud update. But with all that, the monitor part seems like something that should already exist.

Sony’s imaging edge app is insanely horrible with my a6400 and is missing some of the features that only exist on the camera’s touchscreen for some reason that many of you could definitely explain better than me. I believe this could be because of the camera’s limitations and the fact that it’s through Wi-Fi rather than wired.

Unionization as a service,7,"Provide easier routes to start a union, possible features might include:

\- Easy access to organizers who can reach out to other employees within the company and begin organizing without the initiator worrying about retribution (or dealing with work politics)

\- Anonymous (but still verified) chat groups where employees can organize without worrying about screenshots and identities being leaked to management

\- Report, document, and publish union busting tactics

\- Election petition filing

\- Fundraising

\- Connect organizers with marketing resources for larger campaigns

EDIT additional why:

Now that we live in such a politically polarized environment it's extremely taboo to bring up subjects that relate to politics or political identity. This has a paralyzing effect on the ability of employees to organize together and represent themselves. What are the current viable options for organizing? Walking around your office and asking everyone how they feel about unions? Sure, you could also send friend requests on Facebook to every single one of your coworkers but that has far worse consequences than simply being fired, plus you lose all anonymity. 

Organizing is really difficult and not often a skill possessed by those working generally in the labor market, nobody should be left out of the benefits of unionization because they lack people skills, charisma, or social standing. By reducing the risk for employees involved the service should give meaningful access to one of our most valuable rights.",rduoge

* can add gifts / rewards to be redeemed with points
* can track task / child proccess
* can assign a deadline for a task


child side:
* can take a task disabling it to other children

Music review/discussion app,2,"So there are movie review apps, youtube has comment sections, and influencers have plenty of feedback from fans on socials. Why not one for music specifically? I know what you are thinking, musicians and artists have social media and can have comments their - but the artist/management can simply delete anything you comment on their posts/tweets. If you go on fandango you can read reviews of films, but they are managed by fandango who acts as a third party, only removing unnecessary hate and spam reviews. 

There is no way for artists to read about what their fans think directly. They just look at stats such as listen time and downloads but you have to stream a song to know if you like it or not, invalidation most stats. It's the repeated listens and sharing with friends that make an artists successful. 

This kind of platform would be a direct way for fans to review new songs and suggestions. Of course you could like or dislike comments in the same fashion as reddit. This would allow an artist to see exactly what people think and have the future potential to stream music like Spotify, but also have a comment section. And at the end of the day it doesn't matter if artists like the platform. It's about if fans like the ability to discuss with other fans the new album or song that came out.

This would be similar to snap locations however it is not as private and uses an algorithm/you have to have your snap settings set to public. And the big difference is anyone from any location can see snaps on the map in any desired location.

This would be a more private type of app. You would have to attend in order to see, post, and save.

I personally spend a lot of time digging through my ever increasing mailbox for some of the content I subscribed to.

- a minimalist mobile interface to read bite-sized content from your favorite content-creators(writers). 
- Sign up to receive a newsletter or article with a username as opposed to your email address.
- In app settings would allow you to control when you want to get notified about new or old materials from your faves.

Local Sports App (Find me a Court),5,"Hey,

The basic problem that this app would solve is that from my personal experience when I used to go play basketball in the local courts near my area, there would be a problem with the player population that day on the court.

I would usually have no idea how many people would show up and how many would have a basketball with them. Now I did have the phone number of a couple of people and I would just text them to ask but there were many other players that I had no idea of. This resulted in times when there were very few players on the court and and you would just waste time and not have much fun or there was no one with a basketball.

On the other hand there was a opposite problem experienced. I went to a court all ready to play and was welcomed with over 30 people trying to play on the same court. Now again in this case you barely got to play and it was a waste of time in the end.

There seemed to be a mismatch in the court many times, for example after playing just a boring 2 v 2 you would find out that the court a few kilometers away had 6 people playing and you could have played full court with them. Or 30 people were jammed in one court while there were 2 other courts that had barely any players there. Only if there was a way players knew which court to go to to enjoy basketball as per their need.

Now here comes an app which lists all basketball courts near you and you can expand the search area if you can travel further easily (up to you). So now you select a court and get to know it's details like location, court condition and maybe some recent pictures or videos of the court. Next you have the option to select that you are going to play at that court and at what time. Your entry will be recorded and there can be some visual that shows the players that want to play at that court along with their timings. You can look at the player details which would have the player's basic bio data and to make things more interesting you add your skills, what position you play and your physical attributes. You can mention if you play with a team or club.

Value of the App ? Now any basketball player would have a good idea in which court and at what time how many players are attending and this way the courts can be utilized in a far better way with people going to courts according to their needs.

FYI, I do not play myself anymore as I am busy with my job but I do think of the problem I used to have a teenager and think about an app for that problem. This concept can be further expanded to other sports with similar problems e.g football, hockey and tennis.",r6fqzm

An app to say bye when you die,18,"Hi :) 

First of all, sorry for my english, but I would like that someone roast the next idea and I would like to explain it the best I can.

I'm trying to taking care of my Instagram / Twitter / LinkedIn / Facebook / etc. accounts and every day I'm exposing a part of my life to a lot of people that, in some way, is interested on it. 

I made a lot of friends and contacts online (more than in the real life) and it's OK but... What happens when I die? 

I'm sure that it's going to be very difficult that a big part of ""my audience"" know it and I think that I would like to send a last email with my thoughts about life... or publish a last photo on Instagram... or send a last tweet. Don't know !

And here is the idea. An app where you can store and program the last messages that you want to publish to your social media or the last mails that you want to send. You should invite by email the people that you want to have the power of publish / send your last words, and for be able to press ""the red button"" they should send a death certificate.

Ideas to reality ( Honest feedback),4,"So I came to realize having an idea be it an app idea, product idea, or whatever, people always have ideas but to implement it and stay consistent is where the real hustle begins. When you have a team to work with who accepts your idea and works towards the idea it becomes a success. Individuals with great ideas such as in this sub just ignore it after they know that it's just one of the thoughts that pass by in their daily thoughts. Not everyone with a great idea becomes a success and also not everyone with great implementing skills becomes successful. It is when both combine in the right proportion it leads to success

So here's where I am thinking about not letting ideas go to waste. I was thinking of an app where you can list your ideas and people can explore ideas and if they like it can be a part of it by sending a request and once the request is accepted, you can contact the idea creator and discuss and if you feel connected, you can go ahead with the idea to make it to reality.

Dab - Your 3D Avatar Home Phone,1,"I'm at the idea stage but would like to hear your guys input or advice on this idea. You can subscribe at [https://www.producthunt.com/upcoming/dab](https://www.producthunt.com/upcoming/dab)

&#x200B;

Introducing the Dab.

Your personal home phone for receiving and making calls with 3D Avatars. You will be able to download the Dab app to set up your device, create your 3D Avatar, receive a Dab Number to receive calls, and add friends and family.

You can put the Dab device on your work office desk, at home in the kitchen, living room, or even Bedroom. The Dab device can be your home phone and can be a fun and exciting way to communicate with friends and family without using your cell phone or computer. Imagine how many people would love to answer your phone call so they can see your Avatar :)

You will be able to control your avatar's facial expression with the app and you can send gestures and animations while in the call.

**Voice Assistant**

Danny will be your calling assistant.

You will be able to say commands like ""Hi Danny, call Mike"" and Danny will call Mike.

**Connecting Multiple Devices**

You will be able to connect to different Dab devices in your home or you can use the Dab app instead of the device. The Dab device that is closes to your phone will ring. Also, say if you are having a conversation on the Dab device in the living room but need to go in the kitchen. Your Dab device in the kitchen will automatically come on (If your phone is near it) without ending the call so you can stay connected with your friends or family no matter where you are in your home.

I would love to use something like this for my home and I wouldn't be upset if no one else buys it or if someone takes the idea. It's all about execution. I have a few friends who are 3D Artist, Mechanical/Electrical Engineers and I can get the app MVP developed.

**Would you use this for your home?**

I know that you can use AR Memoji's and Filters on apps but thought it would be great to have your own home device just for receiving or making calls with your customize 3D Avatar. If I do pursue this idea and if everyone wants to use it then I can come out with other features for it. Like, users can create their own voicemail with an animation or Dab For Businesses where you can have a second account with professional attire for receiving incoming calls from businesses and the businesses will have their own AI and work avatars.

I'm talking well-known creeps who send lewd pictures to women, artists who trash talk clients while other clients are around, artists who make people remove certain clothing items when it is totally unnecessary but the client may not know that in the moment. So I just thought it would be really cool for someone to make an app that is like Yelp but solely for tattoo shop reviews. Maybe with a likert scale for how comfortable the artist made you feel, how well they prepped, how clean the place is, if they were heavy-handed, and info about their aftercare process and what they offer. Maybe anonymous and non-anonymous options, and a picture upload feature. I think there should be a way to warn others about potentially dangerous or inappropriate situations that could be avoided by going to a higher-rated shop.

* A choice of how to monitor the progress, eg. Notification area on Windows/Control Centre for Mac or picture in picture
* If it's a percentage an even smaller version could go to the taskbar or menu bar

App idea: Hybrid chat mobile app,2,"I know mobile chat application is a crowded and dominated space by applications such as Messanger, Wechat, WhatsApp, Viber ect..

App concept:

However, the app would be a hybrid chat mobile app where there would be a regular WhatsApp-like text message UI and also a virtual chatroom similar to what can be found in video games. The user can either use memoji (android/iPhone own emojis) for their virtual character face or select an in house default one (cartoon like). Since it may hard to read conversations from the virtual chat (small text bubbles with the option of expanding them) with large groups, the user would have the possibility to split the screen in half with virtual chat room at the top and regular text message UI at the bottom.

To make the conversation a little more interactive, user would have the option to choose a status (online, away, traveling, sleeping etc..) to let others know and depending on the status selected the avatar would change. For example, if you choose sleeping status your avatar would display as sleeping and so on. In future versions, the user will eventually be able to select among many different type of built-in (cartoon like) virtual backgrounds.

To monetize the app advertising would be used but in order to not disrupt users it would be displayed either on the avatar or in the background. For example: if the ad is for a clothing company, its logo would automatically display on the avatars (for the duration of the contract), if it’s a coffee company the log could either display in the background of the virtual chat room or on one of the props or make avatars hold a cup of coffee with logo on it.

What are your thoughts? Would it be something you would use? Feel free to shoot any additional features or any app name ideas!

App for finding other digital nomads and share costs,1,"Nowadays it's not hard to find a job that you can work from home or anywhere in the world. I actually work as a software engineer and traveling across Brazil.

And for example, when you have to get airbnb and you are alone, you are probably going to get something not very good because the better options are more expensive. This is what i am going through right now. I wish i could get a more sophisticated apartment, closer to the beach, with pool, and other fancy stuff, but the thing is: i don't have anyone to share the bills.

To make the conversation more interactive, user would have the option to choose statuses (online, away, traveling, sleeping etc..) to let other contacts know about your availability. Depending on the status selected the virtual character would change accordingly. For example, if you choose sleeping status your avatar would display as sleeping and so on.   
To monetize the app advertising could be used but in order to not disrupt users with popups and whatnot the ads would be displayed either on the memojis character itself or in the conversation background. For example: if the ad is for a clothing company, its logo would automatically display on all the characters (for the duration of the contract). Another monetization stream could be the sale of virtual characters' skins like in video games.

You can track your progress and see how far you got in your recovery journey. The main idea is to provide for a user easy and friendly social support in difficult situation.",rlazev
An mental health support app for people that go to the same school,1,"So school shootings have been a huge problem, and so has the increase in student suicides and mental health issues. I'm thinking of making an app for people that go to the same school to connect with each other (anonymously or not) in mental health chat groups. Different chat groups for different things (eating disorders, anxiety, depression, etc.) So students can feel more connected to their community.

Of course this idea has potential problems. It has to be moderated in order to avoid offensive things, and there has to be a way to ensure that only people that actually go to the school get into school's group (maybe they have to put in their school IDs). But just an idea.",rvccxb

Everyone has to pay 5 dollars in order to enter. Whoever walks the most steps after a month wins all of the money. That got me thinking, maybe I could make an app that gave people the opportunity to do this with strangers. Like start your own competition, or choose any competition, and compete to win all of the money. Maybe you could even divide the money into first, second, or third place. And I guess it doesn't have to be just walking, that's just what I thought of.",rsviz8
Find My Pet,2,"An app that has two purposes:

1. A means to report a pet that is running free with GPS coordinates and a photo. (it is not always possible or a good idea to let a pet into your yard) If you do let the pet into your yard, you could choose to make your contact info available to logged-in users.
2. A way for a user to see all missing pets in their area when their pet is missing.

Can be especially useful over the holiday season when many pets escape their yard due to fireworks etc.",rstzyz

Community Aide/Emergency App,1,"What if you have an emergency and need assistance faster than the police and medics can get to you? So how about there be a way for people in all communities to opt in to helping in the event of an emergency? Then, 911 dispatch could alert your nearest neighbor(s) to come to your aid. Or you could even opt to open said app and request emergency assistance from the community yourself. Would need to have a loud alert much like the amber alerts so it can be heard regardless of the time. Could also give people the option to only be available during certain hours as well as set times/days away. This would create community togetherness and help in many different situations in which police/medics take 20+ minutes to respond.",rskwi7
Political War Social Media App,3,"Increasingly, over the last few year, I noticed that people regard their political beliefs more like teams than actual thought-out ideas. Similar to football fans, they hate the other team and support their team no matter what. Then, why not capitalize on it? Twitter kinda does it but in half-assed way. 

So, my idea is to create a social media app where you can follow your favorite political teams such as (Communism, Anarchism, Conservatism, Populism, etc) and concurrent news will be presented daily. Each team has a forum where they provide their opinion on the matter at hand. Then, for each news story, you can check the most voted opinion from each team which will kinda act like the voice of the team. Therefore, other teams can provide a rebuttal to the to top most voted opinions from other teams and fight. 

Opinions are not limited to comments, but also short videos explaining their opinion on the news. 

Obviously, in terms of the marketing strategy and optics for the app, the app will present itself as market place for all people and ideas where conversation and arguments occur to reach the best solutions on current news.",rsko9m
App for Gout & Kidney stone foods,1,"I’ll try to give a short and sweet summary as I have questions that people may have solutions to. Any and all feedback appreciated.

I currently have gout & previously had kidney stones. Biggest change that immediately occurs is diet & water intake. 

A large amount of misinformation and confusing data, one website says eating x is okay when you’ve had stones or gout, the second link will say the complete opposite. 

The more direct information (for my type of stones etc & gout) is to eat foods that do not raise uric acid levels (this is caused by purines) 

I’d like to be able to scan the barcodes of food, or just search (because a family friends dinner won’t have a barcode) something along the lines of my fitness pal, the problem from research that I’ve found is that the data required isn’t included in a large amount of foods in the barcode data.

I’ve searched for databases with APIs trying to find this information but no luck so far.

- What are other means possible for attaining this information? 
- is there possibly other metrics that can be used to measure if a food or drink is suitable for a users condition?
- Huge milestone but is there a possibility to have it reviewed by health organisations to gain some form of accreditation for accuracy or approval?",rshsa3

New music app for collaborative or fun fans—artists,1,"An app that is collaborative, in the sense of upload of music— a different platform aimed at engaging with viewers or collaborative ones, moreso groups n a chat aimed at assisting fans or artist group hopefully together on sharing remixes new lines different beats n collaborative in grand ways easily like your swiping on bands like tinder peak new songs come in with a fresh line or a similar song/beat and perhaps focusing on YouTube since collaborative brings music videos or remix capabilities adds more for the artist and a great growing sense for the fans. so it’d be focused on creation there could be pools or groups of people like a chat for social or lyrics and don’t think about pay when it can be endorsed or sponsored! that can pay well and used as a group lottery amongst artist and collaborators. with collaborative ness and a vast genre or arrray of topics on songs it could have its own twitch channel for artist while Covid is still apparent for some you kinda get what I’m getting at? I’ve ran through it in my head I think if you make a song special for one it could be special for many or learn something that you’d include in another special song, but this could be better for an artist in a switch of genre hopefully have all the artists music stream able or at least a link",rqqhmk
An App for Elementary & Middle School students to learn and master the Multiplication Tables,1,"As a Math tutor, I find that the struggle most students have with Math often arise from having not mastered the Multiplication Tables. Topics like Factors & Multiples, Fractions, Ratios & Proportions, are difficult for students whose number sense do not stretch to the Multiplication Tables. Sure, they know some facts, even understand the definition of Multiplication, but the lack of proficiency in recalling the facts as quickly as possible, makes them struggle in advance topics in Math requiring such skills.

People have verified profiles with reviews, so you don't have to be afraid of someone poisoning your food or something lol.

An app for people to do favors for each other,13,"Not random favors, but kind of like community service for people that genuinely need help. Also like go fund me, except it not specifically money, its more a deed you do to help someone out. You input skills you have, and see posts on your feed from people that need those skills.

Like someone needs to make a commercial for a charity or fundraiser. Someone else with video experience makes them this commercial. This will give the video maker experience, as well as positive reviews and exposure. That's just a random example I thought of, I'm sure there are better examples. I feel like this will bring people closer together, and focus on community and connectiveness.

Now of course, people might abuse this. They might pretend to be desperate for something when they really aren't, just to get a free service. This is something that needs to be worked around.",rzi2e8

So if Jack thinks restaurant A is overrated, but B,C and D are underrated, and if Jessica thinks A is overrated but C is underrated, then system will suggest Jessica B and D.

DeApps are the trend of next few years,33,"Hey guys, how's it going? Don't you think that things in our world are clearly a bit stale and have stopped progressing? It's not for nothing that there is a phrase in our world, ""Conquest is the engine of progress"" and it seems to me that someone has stopped progressing altogether. If you're wondering who I am, I mean the AppStore and PlayMarket.

These two giants have completely stopped progressing and are just robbing us. Quality is getting worse and cost is getting higher, content is constantly being paid for and so on. I think they don't have long to go and other promising projects will replace them.

Take Magic Square. They are already testing a new type of platform for Magic Store apps. It will be a completely new and unique system for both developers and users. Developers have already got an improved and easier system to launch their products, and we, the users testing the applications can get our bonuses and then, obviously, get a better product.

All this because there is a rising opportunity of going big and becoming the Unicorn entrepreneur or successfully commencing the development plans of their app idea and starting their dream project.

There are plenty of app ideas and unicorn business proposals doing the rounds in the market and many entrepreneurs are in search of a good idea that would give them better profits. On that note,  let’s take a look at some of the excellent app ideas that could make your venture an enterprising one with an opportunity to earn better ROI for years to come.

There will be a number of care-takers. 
There will be a list of routine, scheduled and unscheduled tasks. Such as : Talking to the person every few days, Taking him/her out on a weekend, taking her to the doctor etc. The app will make sure tasks are assigned to a caregiver. 

When one of the caregivers cannot be available, s/he can ask someone else in the caregiver list to handle the task. Someone in the caregiver list can show up and own the task.",s1yd47
Random Workout Generator,1,"Features:

3) Level (Easy, Medium, Hard)

And the app will create a random workout for user. E.g. 30 minutes Easy workout for Office (meaning no running or jumping around)

User will be able to modify the Locations by saying ""I don't want to see this workout at this location"" so certain workouts can be excluded forever.",s1y8pe
Group Travel App,2,"The idea here is basically an itinerary planner that helps you get on the same page with everyone involved in a trip and has the functionality to help with budgeting the trip, voting on a hotel/airbnb, and planning all the things you would like to do in a given area.

Users can easily vote on their stay at first and then on different events/experiences and on which dates they want to do those events/experiences. Once a stay is agreed on, you can see the driving distance to all the events/experiences in the trip and calculate the cost of gas automatically given the rental car your using and other useful tidbits like that to help calculate some of the hidden costs so that no one is blindsided by unexpected costs.

There are already plenty of trip itinerary apps, but none that I am aware of that help people plan together as a group with things like in-app polls/voting and choosing dates and a budget that works for everyone.

This idea stems from having some very large and disorganized group trips with friends where people weren't aware of the prices of certain things or what the group was doing on what day and this caused problems that could have easily been solved if all the trip info was neatly organized into an app rather than having it thrown around in a group messaging chat.

I'm a full-stack software engineer who is already building this for myself to use with my friends before I release it on the web and app stores so feel free to give any suggestions or feedback.",s1x9a1

If you allow voice chat then you get to see the complete profile of the person and you can connect with that person permanently and share all forms of media.

I want to know if this sounds interesting to anyone? Also is there something similar already in the market or not? Shall i go ahead and finish it up or not?",s1co55
"DAO is one of the prospects for near future, but is it for long..",36," Many cryptocurrency users are tired of switching between tabs, login into various sites, and keeping track of an ever-growing array of wallets, keys, and passwords.  
A quick Google search reveals hundreds of crypto investing courses for sale to the general public: innumerable youtube videos and channels dedicated to teaching the system's complexity. In addition to buckets of ink spilt while attempting to make sense of this intricate system: papers, books, blogs, and so on. All of this demonstrates that utilizing cryptocurrency is not straightforward or user-friendly.

Crypto is designed by nerds for geeks, which poses a clear challenge for normal consumers. People are discouraged from participating in the cryptosphere on a regular basis since it is difficult and controversial. This is especially regrettable given blockchain's huge potential to disrupt and democratize the digital world as we know it. Blockchain adoption will not be mainstream until crypto becomes more user-friendly.

  
There needs to be one consolidated, user-friendly place for users to experience crypto applications and services. We need an app store just for crypto. And this one already exists. But in the test stage. If it can cope, we will be able to use blockchain technologies in the most comfortable way. It exists in the form of Magic Square‘s Magic Store, the first true marketplace for cryptocurrency-related applications. It functions so simply, users are shocked at how easy and streamlined exploring the crypto world of apps has now become.

  
For quality control, apps offered on the Magic Store are approved by a community of users. As a result, we no longer need to be concerned about frauds or malicious programs. In addition, the Magic Store categorizes and filters apps, allowing us to locate exactly what you're looking for.",s1az5v

Hirers can find workers to do jobs  based on their working experience and skill level in which all workers will have verified accounts to show that they represent the app. These can be jobs either outside such as lawn mowing, car washing, cleaning the gutters or inside such as cleaning or moving things around.

DeAppStore is near ahead,32,"The difficulty with Satoshi Nakomoto's anonymity (or, according to many, its greatest value) is that it propelled decentralization to the forefront of public consciousness. Since then, crypto businesses, applications, NFTs, and even crypto games have had to demonstrate or promise complete decentralization in order to be accepted by the crypto community.

Decentralization has evolved into a pseudo-religion. People evaluate items based on their degree of decentralization, and anything with a smidgeon of centralization is discarded. But this preoccupation isn't grounded in reality.  
In truth, not all blockchain applications are made equal, and certain data does not need to be saved on the blockchain. Some pieces of information necessitate more privacy and censorship resistance, whereas others do not. A monetary transaction is likely to be recorded and preserved on-chain, but the design for a crypto game is likely to be hosted on a central server.

Despite the fragmented nature of decentralization, one approach is to establish a second layer to fulfill the demands of the user and offer a unified experience. Magic Square is accomplishing this by offering the first crypto app store, which is a centralized location for consumers to find, utilize, and connect with the crypto community.  
Many layer2 solutions are highly centralized to provide the level of experience users are looking for. But Magic Square has created a unique solution that provides a highly decentralized layer2 buffer for cryptocurrency-based applications. Magic Square achieves this by powering the platform with a community of validators. Almost all Magic Square decisions are decided by the community which makes the platform especially attractive for the decentralized community.",s0kp51
An Exercise-Based Productivity App,1,"So I was thinking while watching the New-Years-Newbies in this gym this morning that were all into their phones and not paying attention to the workout at hand that it would be great if there was an app that could remind them to get up and move periodically through the day, as well as teach them exercises, similar to what Bod Bot does, so they aren't floundering in the gym.

 But the difference is that it would gamify the workouts, with a social media-like aspect to it. As for push notifications, it would be based on screen time, similar to what Duolingo does when it guilt trips you into using it after you know... not using it for a while. Additionally, there would be various levels of locking their phones at the users' command so they can focus if they want.

I need some feedback on a Life organising app,5,"Hi everyone! I need some feedback on an idea i have had for some time...

There are a lot of apps out in there that will help you organise some aspect of your life, for example: todo's, shopping lists, fridge/pantry organizer, habit trackers, birthday calendar, workout trackers .... but these are all individual apps.Almost none of them have an open API that would let you integrate all this data in one single dashboard/app.My idea is to make an app that would let your track/organise all aspects of your life...basically it's a combination of all useful apps out there combined into one. But with a major advantage, the various modules would be linked to each other.

So for example you could have a ""Household"" module where you define a bathroom that needs cleaning ever x days (or you can set it do dirty as needed :) ) ... this cleaning task would automatically become an entry in the ToDo module, where it can be assigned to someone in the household.Once the ToDo task is done, the bathroom cleaning would automatically be reset in the Household module.

Another example could be about the fridge/pantry module and the amount left of a produce... this could be automatically be suggested in the shopping list. Once the item is  ticked off the shopping list, the ""Amount available"" in the pantry module would be reset to ""Full"". Based on the available produce in the pantry... a recipe could be suggested.

What do you guys think? Would this be useful?What ""modules"" would you want  to see  in such an app and how would you use the data that is inputted?

Thanks for the help!",s05ixc

\_answering my question and i prefer it in a short way not narrating a whole long paragraph (i think i have to access some database or something)

\_doing tasks like opening an application in my pc (like calculator or calendar or something)

plz tell me the steps i should take and the technologies i have to use and give me some guidance.",s9k74u

Property Market explorer,2,"Can’t find any good websites which can give a breakdown of what kind of buildings/aminites/ business /transport for a X-mile radius  from a property.

Manually looking this on google maps is cumbersome and difficult if wanted to compare multiple locations 

Also might include other useful metrics like population trends / property build dates etc if available .
Worth building an app/ dashboard which can do this ?",s90uei
Smart Meal Planning App,4,"Not a dev or entrepreneur; just had an idea. I don't know if this exists or not already.

The meat and potatoes of the app would be the ability to input your own recipes/meals into the app. Want to add mom's eggplant parmesan? Just make a 'card' for it. A card would be the ingredients and instructions. The feature of the app that makes it a meal planning app would be the ability to schedule meals in advance for however far into the future (max a month maybe) and how many meals you would like to make. The meals would be randomized and you can set how often you would like meals to repeat (though there would be some limitations if you have few recipes - think the shuffle feature on music streaming apps). Another feature of the app is the grocery list; the app would make a list of all the ingredients in the correct amounts you need to make the meals for that week/month (would depend on how often you go grocery shopping). Finally, when it's time to cook, you can go to the meal's recipe card and read the instructions.

Let me know what y'all think!",s8cn97
What would the PERFECT listening/stats feature for a podcast look like?,1,"I'm working on a podcast app. I have an idea for a new stats feature. Before I reveal the feature, I want to get some ideas from potential users. If you are an avid podcast listener, this is your chance to have your voices heard. 

I will reveal my idea once I get over 100 comments or 100 upvotes whichever comes first.",s88imd
I made a website (soon to be app) that functions in a similar way as the old StumbleUpon. How can I make it more awesome?,8,"I'm not ready to launch, so I won't say what it's called yet (plus, I don't want to violate any self-promotion rules, even though it's still in development). But basically, the current functionality is push button --> random website from a personally curated list of destinations (3000+ and counting). It's an assortment of fun/interesting websites, as well as videos (documentaries, music videos, upcoming movie trailers, random YT videos I like), music (mostly sourced from SoundCloud and Spotify, but will probably add other sources), and images (infographics, wallpapers, artsy stuff).

That's the nutshell version. It's currently all being randomly pulled from the same bucket, so to speak, and anything that's a video or music track appears as an embedded player from the source (i.e. YouTube player, SoundCloud player, Spotify playlist widget, etc).

Basic features I'm working on (in order of priority):

1) Membership option - free registration and all that. Perks will be that you can bookmark your favorite discoveries, filter ""interests"" from the random pool (include/omit certain types of sites), and I guess make a basic profile page.

2) Add a way to separately randomize videos, music, and everything else, so that you can potentially listen to a discovered music track or have a floating video player while browsing websites (not too sure aesthetically what would be best here yet).

3) Piggybacking off of the first feature, I want to implement a social element to all of this, so you can make friends and combine interest pools or ""send"" discoveries to each other. Also, you can see how many other users favorited a website, or if any of your friends already did. Still thinking of the logistics of this, but I like the idea

4) Eventually, I'd like to do a submission system, but that's a ways away. Maybe there can be a credit system or something (like karma here, for example) based on how often a user uses the site, and when you reach a certain point, you're trustworthy enough to submit (I'd obviously have to review the submission)

So, there you have it. This is all for fun (as well as a crash course on coding for me), but I want to make it as great as possible. No paid ads, if I can avoid it.

All of this in mind I have a couple of questions to the community:

1) What would you like to see from a project like this? If you've ever used a tool like StumbleUpon, Mix, etc...were there any wishlist features you would have liked, and what were the annoyances and/or features you didn't care for?

2) More on the technical side... Does anyone know of an efficient way to mass-categorize websites, based on interest categories (I'd rather not personally go one-by-one and categorize them myself)? I've considered trying to web scrape with Google meta data, but this info isn't available for everything.

Thanks for reading, and thanks for any suggestions/tips. This has been a lot of fun to develop so far.",s7txp0
A web app where anyone will b able to download books (pdf) containing puzzles and brain teasers dor free,1,"hi everyone,
i found that there is a storm of people buying such books at etsy and amazon. digital versions are v popular as well. so, why not take a robinhood approach and make these books available to download for free while make money using Ads!!!???
I am sure that these puzzles can be generated using AI  programming. So, we can publish books pretty much everyday!
These books will help everyone to reduce screen time, would be great fun during playdates etc.
Any one want to join me on that?
Your comments are welcome.
Cheers :)",s7nbv4
Advanced programmable email filter,1,"*Forgive me if this already exists.*

I would totally pay a monthly subscription for a service which used IMAP to intercept my email before it came to me and performed a series of programmable functions to filter unwanted messages.

Some examples of programmable functions could be:

* If there's an unsubscribe link, automatically visit the link and then move the email to junk, then auto block this domain forever.  I realize that not everyone would want this so it should be a toggled option. Or perhaps a configured option like: block for (\_period\_of\_time\_) unless (\_message\_contains\_password\_reset\_link\_) and (\_content\_from\_list\_you've\_made\_).
* I get loads scam emails everyday from hastily set up gmail accounts like: advancedserviceforyou-at-gmail-dot-com.  I would love it if I could auto-block all traffic from a gmail addresses, unless I've sent an email to one specific gmail address previously.
* Continuing with the scam emails: I get a lot of emails from 'businesses' who have purchased a goDaddy domain name and installed the most basic email-in-a-box software and are sending me scam emails.  When you visit the domain name there's no forward facing website just the standard boilerplate for goDaddy domains which are using the default DNS records.  I would love a function which visits the domain name and checks to see if there's some actual content like images, non-lorem-ipsum text and a minimum word count(maybe 200). All of these could be toggles since not everyone would want to perform these checks.
   * Building on this, it could also be a good idea to scan the DNS records and make sure they have at least one non-standard A record, and or CNAME record.  If they're using the default NameCheap, GoDaddy, or other domain host's default dns settings then the email would get filtered.
* 'Content quality'.  Exact phrase matching is standard fare for all basic email filters, but lacks expandability.  With even the most basic ML tools you can can scan for phrases which resemble those found on a list.  It wouldn't take a lot of effort to surmise that this email is trying to sell you something,  they've misspelled loads of words, and have hidden characters from MS Word(or whatever else).

All of the third party email filters I'm aware of perform checks which are rudimentary in nature.  They're easily overwhelmed by low-effort changes made by scammers.  I know many services like Gmail or Outlook online perform advanced filtering, but it takes little effort for a scammer to sign up for a free account at one of these services and try stuff until an unblocked email arrives.  User configured filters would be much harder to overcome, because the exact methodology is hidden from the sender, and it would be different from one user to another.  For example I have a firm rule that I never work with a company who has sent me unsolicited email. Whereas another user might have a more flexible approach and wish to receive marketing emails only from specific senders like: Amazon, Tesla, etc

One example of a user-configured filter string could be something like this:

If:

* The sender has no public facing website
* And
   * You've never sent an email to this domain before
   * The email contains content which originates from another domain
* Or
   * subject contains any (\_2\_) (\_phrases\_) from (\_scam\_email\_content\_list\_)
   * And
      * The email contains a tracking pixel
      * Header (\_value\_) contains (\_word\_) from (\_list\_)

Then:

* Block domain for (\_6\_) (\_months\_)
* And
   * Move to: (\_scam\_) folder
   * Mark (\_read\_)
   * Notify (\_me\_) by (\_follow\_up\_email\_) in (\_6\_)(\_months\_)

&#x200B;

Filters should be toggled off and on.  For example if a user is actively searching for a job then they may wish to receive emails who's subject contains: 'LinkedIn' or 'Linked In'.  Whereas if a user is not actively searching for a job these emails become quickly overwhelming. This filter could be toggled off until the user is ready to entertain job offers and then be toggled on for a period of time.

In order for this to be effective I think there would have to be a user-consumable log which allowed the user to perform subtle tweaks on a message by message basis.  For example: if the user wants to block all email from gmail but wishes to whitelist a specific address, they could do this from the log.

These are just my two cents, Im curious what you all think.",s74jaw
An app for tutors to immediately explain a concept/question to a student one on one,3,"So I have an idea for this app that is kind of like Upwork, where you post a job and proposals start coming in. Except its a bit more casual, as its just students posting questions and tutors jumping in to explain it to them. Someone signs in as a tutor, inputs what kind of information they specialize in, and what their charging rate is. Students sign in to a profile, input a payment method, and start asking questions. Tutors then start receiving leads that are student questions pertaining to the information they specialize in. They have the option to take the lead, or pass it. If the students are satisfied with the tutors help, they give them a five star rating, and the tutor gets paid. Just to clarify, this isn't long term, in depth help. Just short and easy personalized help from a qualified tutor.",s6guad

YouTube dislike extension more added features,8,"Do what you will with my thoughts , just felt like it needed to be heard . 

The idea of putting the numbers back is good. But I also feel like it should have a record of the dislikes to prevent google from resetting the counter. 
Perhaps maybe initiating a program that takes to account of the view to like ratio and assume that no likes turns into a dislike. It would be mostly beneficial to YouTubers who actually do good jobs and earn their likes rather than corporations trying to hide that nobody likes their products.

What other ideas do you think the extension should have?",s5rtjy
Browser Extension IDEA that SKIPS ADS?,0,"I don't know anything about programming, but I was curious if my browser extension idea would be possible.

The extension would allow the user to play YouTube videos without any ads.

Something I noticed when watching YouTube... If I click on a video, an ad will play first and then the video. If I hit my back button on my browser and then the forward button on my browser, then the video will play immediately without an ad.

Could an extension effect a mouse click on a video + perform a ""previous page"" operation on the browser + then perform a ""next page"" operation on the browser all at once?

Hopefully, this would allow one to watch videos without an ad playing.

If possible, someone make this, it would be so nice.",s5hzz4
