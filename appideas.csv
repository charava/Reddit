Simple survey based app idea,1,"Hi guys, 
I need an opinion about a survey site idea.
Basically, the app would have of two types of users:
1. Users who posts survey (Google Form link) and pays any amount of money for users to fulfill the form.
2. Users who fill surveys for money.

Key feature - amount of money the users (2.) receives for answering the survey depends on the money the user (1.) is willing to pay per survey submittion

I know there are already tons of websites like this, but I could not find the Google Forms version, and neither a site that is not filled with bunch of other content (like affiliate links, earning some stupid coins, etc.)

It would be a pure cash based website with instant payment and payouts (probably PayPal).

Thanks :)",r2410b

"App that allows people to explore the inside of buildings, similar to Google Street view.",0,"I've been thinking, an app that allows people to 'walk' virtually in a store/ hospital before they go in it would be awesome.
It would be great for those with anxiety to plan ahead on where they need to go, for people with PTSD to find exits just in case (I have PTSD and knowing where exits are is a must), for those with bowel problems to know where restrooms are ahead of time, and much more.

Maybe eventually it could help lead the blind to stores they want to go to.

I know obviously this would take alot of work, but getting the idea out there might lead to a more accessible world.",r1m6q7

"Alarm App with Voice Memo, Incentives And Punishment and Games to play.",1,"An Alarm app

1. Voice Alarm :  you can send an voice message to your friends and family and that will be played as alarm in morning. 

2. Incentives and Punishment : If you Stopped the alarm on time you will get medals and XP increasing your level on leaderboard and some coins to unlock more skins and sounds (app assets), And If you ignores the alarm for about 5min or snoozed then the device will be locked and you will have to watch 5ads and if you snooze again 5 more ads will add and so on. When user will finally stop the alarm then all the punishment ads will be displayed.

3. Play mini games to stop alarm : there are many apps that includes maths, puzzle, etc as a challenge to stop the alarm but there's no alarm app that have mini games as a challenge to stop alarm. (mini games similar to facebook games or other quick games, yk)

Ideas to reality ( Honest feedback),3,"So I came to realize having an idea be it an app idea, product idea, or whatever, people always have ideas but to implement it and stay consistent is where the real hustle begins. When you have a team to work with who accepts your idea and works towards the idea it becomes a success. Individuals with great ideas such as in this sub just ignore it after they know that it's just one of the thoughts that pass by in their daily thoughts. Not everyone with a great idea becomes a success and also not everyone with great implementing skills becomes successful. It is when both combine in the right proportion it leads to success

So here's where I am thinking about not letting ideas go to waste. I was thinking of an app where you can list your ideas and people can explore ideas and if they like it can be a part of it by sending a request and once the request is accepted, you can contact the idea creator and discuss and if you feel connected, you can go ahead with the idea to make it to reality. The business idea will be enclosed with NDA(non-disclosure agreement).

Dab - Your 3D Avatar Home Phone,1,"I'm at the idea stage but would like to hear your guys input or advice on this idea. You can subscribe at [https://www.producthunt.com/upcoming/dab](https://www.producthunt.com/upcoming/dab)



Introducing the Dab.

Your personal home phone for receiving and making calls with 3D Avatars. You will be able to download the Dab app to set up your device, create your 3D Avatar, receive a Dab Number to receive calls, and add friends and family.

You can put the Dab device on your work office desk, at home in the kitchen, living room, or even Bedroom. The Dab device can be your home phone and can be a fun and exciting way to communicate with friends and family without using your cell phone or computer. Imagine how many people would love to answer your phone call so they can see your Avatar :)

You will be able to control your avatar's facial expression with the app and you can send gestures and animations while in the call.

Voice Assistant

Danny will be your calling assistant.

You will be able to say commands like ""Hi Danny, call Mike"" and Danny will call Mike.

Connecting Multiple Devices

You will be able to connect to different Dab devices in your home or you can use the Dab app instead of the device. The Dab device that is closes to your phone will ring. Also, say if you are having a conversation on the Dab device in the living room but need to go in the kitchen. Your Dab device in the kitchen will automatically come on (If your phone is near it) without ending the call so you can stay connected with your friends or family no matter where you are in your home.

I would love to use something like this for my home and I wouldn't be upset if no one else buys it or if someone takes the idea. It's all about execution. I have a few friends who are 3D Artist, Mechanical/Electrical Engineers and I can get the app MVP developed.

Would you use this for your home?

I know that you can use AR Memoji's and Filters on apps but thought it would be great to have your own home device just for receiving or making calls with your customize 3D Avatar. If I do pursue this idea and if everyone wants to use it then I can come out with other features for it. Like, users can create their own voicemail with an animation or Dab For Businesses where you can have a second account with professional attire for receiving incoming calls from businesses and the businesses will have their own AI and work avatars.

Would a website specifically for freelance developers (to find assignments/jobs) be ideal for you?,0,"Foreword: This isn't about self-promotion. I don't know if this one is a survey. But the goal is to support freelance developers. If this post gets deleted, then it's fine by me.

Hello freelance developers (or anyone who wants to be a freelancer in the future)

I am planning to make a simple non-profit website where potential clients like a baker can post an assignment/job. They need to enter the title as summary what they want, description for more details and their email address so developers can contact them. An assignment is basically a request for freelance developers to make an app for them. It can be a website, mobile app, etc. everything related to IT development.

These assignments are visible for us freelance developers as a list (you can also filter assigments) to see and choose which one we want to work on. You can see the email address of the person who posted this assignment so you can initiate a call. You can also filter assignments based on whether if it's about bugfixes that needs to be fixed, or to extend their existing app or start an app completely from scratch, or mixed and more. And you can search assignments by keywords you're typing.

Click on one of the assignments will navigate you to the detail page. On that page, a more detailed description and contact info like email address of the client are visible. You can contact the client by email (or by phone, the project can and mostly will, evolve). And after that moment, it's all between you two: the client e.g. the baker and a developer (you). There are no middleman, no fees. You and the client discuss how the payment should be processed: by bank transfer, cash, or trade, etc. Entirely up to you. So basically, this project is more community driven. The development and maintenance support can be handled by ads and/or donation.

So this app is really simple: it provides you a (filtered) list of all the assignments of every potential client around the world, you can see and decide for yourself which one to pick, call the client and off you go. No middleman, no fees, it's now all on you and the client.

Yes there are other related services like Fiverr, Upwork, etc. but they charge you a lot, middleman standing between the two and those services is not entirely focussed on development and more. But the goal of this app is to provide all the freedom to the IT community.



Update: The app is halfway there. If, at the end, it turns out not to be popular, then I won't consider it as a waste. At least it will belong to one of my hobby projects.",r3p55w

An app to say bye when you die,14,"Hi :) 

First of all, sorry for my english, but I would like that someone roast the next idea and I would like to explain it the best I can.

I'm trying to taking care of my Instagram / Twitter / LinkedIn / Facebook / etc. accounts and every day I'm exposing a part of my life to a lot of people that, in some way, is interested on it. 

I made a lot of friends and contacts online (more than in the real life) and it's OK but... What happens when I die? 

I'm sure that it's going to be very difficult that a big part of ""my audience"" know it and I think that I would like to send a last email with my thoughts about life... or publish a last photo on Instagram... or send a last tweet. Don't know !

And here is the idea. An app where you can store and program the last messages that you want to publish to your social media or the last mails that you want to send. You should invite by email the people that you want to have the power of publish / send your last words, and for be able to press ""the red button"" they should send a death certificate.

Local Sports App (Find me a Court),4,"Hey,

The basic problem that this app would solve is that from my personal experience when I used to go play basketball in the local courts near my area, there would be a problem with the player population that day on the court.

I would usually have no idea how many people would show up and how many would have a basketball with them. Now I did have the phone number of a couple of people and I would just text them to ask but there were many other players that I had no idea of. This resulted in times when there were very few players on the court and and you would just waste time and not have much fun or there was no one with a basketball.

On the other hand there was a opposite problem experienced. I went to a court all ready to play and was welcomed with over 30 people trying to play on the same court. Now again in this case you barely got to play and it was a waste of time in the end.

There seemed to be a mismatch in the court many times, for example after playing just a boring 2 v 2 you would find out that the court a few kilometers away had 6 people playing and you could have played full court with them. Or 30 people were jammed in one court while there were 2 other courts that had barely any players there. Only if there was a way players knew which court to go to to enjoy basketball as per their need.

Now here comes an app which lists all basketball courts near you and you can expand the search area if you can travel further easily (up to you). So now you select a court and get to know it's details like location, court condition and maybe some recent pictures or videos of the court. Next you have the option to select that you are going to play at that court and at what time. Your entry will be recorded and there can be some visual that shows the players that want to play at that court along with their timings. You can look at the player details which would have the player's basic bio data and to make things more interesting you add your skills, what position you play and your physical attributes. You can mention if you play with a team or club.

Value of the App ? Now any basketball player would have a good idea in which court and at what time how many players are attending and this way the courts can be utilized in a far better way with people going to courts according to their needs.

FYI, I do not play myself anymore as I am busy with my job but I do think of the problem I used to have a teenager and think about an app for that problem. This concept can be further expanded to other sports with similar problems e.g football, hockey and tennis.",r6fqzm
