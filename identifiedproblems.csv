A way to make android gaming controls more usable and similar to console.,0,"Is there a way to use the movement of your device to trigger onscreen buttons? Let's say you are playing an emulator and the original console controls required the use of 4 different inputs at once. Two thumbs and then a finger on each trigger. Many games use controls like this, and it's why playing shooters on the phone feels so clunky. When using on screen controls you can only use your two thumbs thus making it uncomfortable to properly play. For example take Minecraft. You look and move around with the joysticks, then attack or place blocks with the triggers, enabling you to simulataniously move whilst interacting. This is a critical factor in immersiveness and general playability of the gaming experience. When your control inputs are limited as they are on touchscreen devices, it forces games to adapt and change, often making console ports hard to enjoy, however creating an interesting variety of unique controls for other games that perhaps were originally designed around this flaw.

Specifically targeting emulators and console ports; games not designed around this flaw in controls, in my opinion this side of things could really do with a way of getting around this problem as it would vastly improve the enjoyability of playing (proper) games on the phone. My solution involves using the accelerometer & gyroscope to detect when the phone was being tapped on the top corners or back, and then mapping these input signals to control a touch button on the display, thus creating artificial trigger buttons for your emulator's.

You would simply hold the phone in a landscape position in a similar way to how you would hold a regular gaming controller, with your fingers resting on the top left and right corners of the screen. Just give them a good tap and that's your button. Surely the phones sensors are sensitive enough for that to be enough to trigger an onscreen reaction. Granted, this would not be a perfect solution as it would only really allow you to tap the triggers and not hold them down, however this could surely be somewhat mitigated by using a combination of all of your phones sensors to detect a purposeful input. The microphone would be able to detect a sound transient upon contact, as well as your gyroscope detecting subtle movements in orientation. Perhaps an extremely subtle flick of the phone toward whichever trigger you wish to press, in conjunction with the tap detected by the microphone, would be the best way to grant this method consistentcy as well as true functionality, via the added support of several sensors working together to detect intentional input.

Would this work, and is it already simple and easy to do with apps currently available?",rbs5ja

I wanna 3D chip/PLA printer.,1,"It should be possible to have a 'four color' 3D printer (P,N,Conductor,non-conductor) chip maker that uses chemical vapor deposition to fabricate integrated chips onto pre-made chip blanks.  Maybe more 'colors' for other specialized components, too... for a deluxe model, to integrate capacitors and inductors and such.  Analog circuits come in handy, after all.

I remember a few articles from long ago about someone doing something like making circuits with an inkjet printer, but nothing for well over 20 years since.  I guess those college students graduated and entered the workforce to pay for their college debts.

Anyways, you'd buy bulk chip blanks with pins preset and pre-soldered onto connection points on a piece of bank, clean silicon (or other substrate), and build up chips like a 3D printer makes other models.  It could use pre-doped/mixed compounds as 'wire' for the P/N junctions, metal wire for the conductor, and something else for the non-conductor.  These would be in separate heads/'pens' to be used for the various stages.  The machine would pause, pick up another 'pen' (wire preloaded/threaded) and continue printing the next layer.  (Which would be a nice feature even for pure plastic 3D printers.)

Since it would deposit vapor from heating/arcing/whatever the materials and shooting them at the chip surface, it wouldn't use any chemicals, but it would probably need some kind of vapor catcher for the gases being drawn out of it by the vaccum.  Otherwise, it would be 'clean' compared to the (sometimes) horrific stuff you need to etch with, to make chips.  All additive.  (Or maybe even just specialized plastics?)

So, you'd design the circuit, put it into the software, connecting up the pin inputs/outputs, the software would simulate, recommend reconfigurations and figure out the optimal order of printing, you say OK, and it starts laying down material, layer by layer, just like 3D printers do.

It would be extremely low resolution compared to the techniques measured in nanometers, but for 99% of things outside of cameras and computers and solid state storage, it really doesn't need to be high resolution, nor does it really matter being super fast in every application.  If you're a hobbyist or developer, it should be accessible and a lot more compact and affordable and convenient than buying bulk transistors and other parts, and playing with breadboard when prototyping.  Plus of course, downloading shit and making it for grins.

You could even have the chip blank anchored into the machine in its own chip socket(s), so it could be tested and probed from outside without putting the cap on or opening the machine up.  Though if you built it up pretty high, you'd probably need its own air tent, and a way to reach in and put a custom cap on manually.

When you think about space colonies and replacement parts, do you really want some crucial chip to blow out twice, and then wait half a year (or more) for a replacement you ordered from Earth?

Sure would be nice if you could print up a replacement in a couple of hours without stocking and transporting harmful chemicals.

It could also (conceivably) print chips in 3D, somewhat overcoming the low resolution problems.  If you go for something like 100 micrometer scale, you could still pack a million transistors into one cubic centimeter.  It'd have to be real low power, though.  (Minus losses for purely structural parts and conductors and whatnot.)

Even at 1mm scale, 1000 transistors/elements in a 1cm block would be attainable.  Or print some bigger transistors as amplifiers/drivers, and such.  So making an 8 bit CPU or SOC would need a couple of centimeters of 1mm cubed voxels.  Maybe voids for airflow/cooling, structural elements, a shell and various other things.  Anyway, when talking mid tower desktop PC scale, you could get a non-trivial amount of computer working by PACKING that volume of space, even at such low resolution.  [There are already open source RISC projects.](https://openrisc.io/)  So why not download a new computer?

You're not gonna make much in a day, just like any current 3D print, but you'll get *something*.

Of course, weird, misshapen 3D printed electronics would be fun, too.",r3bwps

Work problems...,9,"So I work at an elementary school through Americorps right? When the schools closed down, the principal (one of my bosses) asked me to check in every day with the vice-principal, Minh. I asked if we could make it a weekly check-in but the vice principal said since principal said we gotta do every day, it's what I have to do.

Well, I did forget some days of the week to check-in. And so my Americorps Supervisor calls me to yell (rant) at me for it.

She's been very inconsistent with the requirements with this whole check-in even though I'm checking in with just the vice principal and not her. Our check-ins are separate. Mind you her job is to make sure I'm doing my job at the school which is why shes concerned with the check-in between me and the vice principal.

In April, since I forgot a couple more days, she called again. And ranted over and over how I'm not professional and even threatening to fire me because I'm being so unprofessional for not checking in with the vice principal. She told me she doesn't care what time I check in just as long as I do it? Since my work at home hrs have been so...all over the place.

Technically it was our Spring Break when I forgot that time so I didn't it was such a big deal.

Well, today she called (EVEN THOUGH I HAVE CHECKED IN every day) and RANTED OVER AND OVER how so I'm so unprofessional and how my check-in times are so late. I asked her what time does she want me to check-in? And I didn't get a specific time. So I send my daily check in to vice-principal and say ill be checking in at 1 pm every day. Then she texts me and says ""NO the requirement is 12:00pm""

She's being very inconsistent with her requirements and expectations and I'm getting sick of her threatening to fire me over this stupid check-in.

Hearing someone call you unreliable, unaccountable, unprofessional, etc. over and over. I cried during our call but I muted it bc I was trying so hard to stay professional.

She said she will not be my reference for whatever job I may be getting next...mind you, I never asked her to.

I don't know what to do. I want to report this to her boss and talk to my vice principal but I don't how to explain it to them.

Thank you for reading this whole thing...I really could use some professional advice on this if there is anything I can do.",g2x57f
I'm stuck in another country with my mom and step-father who apparently can't stop fighting each other,13,"Hi

Well, I'm originally from South America, I live there with my dad. This February I had to come to Europe, where I lived in for seven years before I went back to my country, so I could help my mom take care of my little brothers until she recovered from a serious surgery. My step-father and her are separated, he usually stays in another city because of work and then comes to the city my mom lives in for two weeks so he can see the kids. That's all good, it works for them, but quarantine messed things up, since my step-dad can't go back to the city. My mom and him fight absolutely all the time, sometimes it's over serious problems and sometimes over really small things. It has been like this since I was 13 years old (I'm currently 21), that's why they separated.

The thing is, all of this is taking a toll on my mental health and I haven't been able to go back to my country. The embassy and airline won't answer my emails. I'm getting sick of it, plus I'm starting online classes.

I don't know how I will manage to stay sane. I've tried talking to them calmly, yelling, putting on my headphones on full volume so I can't hear them, going to another room but it doesn't work since the apartment is tiny and I don't have a bedroom for myself.

What can I possibly do? I'm genuinely desperate.",g2oc25
Online school (not serious),5,"This is very mild, and will probably make me sound bratty, but here we go.

My close friends for three years in high school are cutting me off,7,I have three best friends throughout my high school life. After many bad experience with friendship groups and drama. I have finally found my close friends in high school which is my ex three close friends now. How it all started in my opinion and what I‚Äôm about to express is what I feel like happened and it could be different on what they have seen or what their side of the story could be. I first met two of my best friends in the end of year 7 when I was bullied with my other toxic friendship groups and when I first met them they were very nice and understanding. They would tell me they would always be here whenever I have problems and they always listened to me complain or rant about my family problems or issues in my life time. I would sometimes make funny jokes like for example how people act and stupid dad jokes. They all laughed and they would always hype me up for the jokes I made and it actually made me happier that someone could finally understand me for who I am. So then my jokes got more funnier and they would laugh more louder. After one year pasted my two close friends made friends with another girl and she joined our group and to be honest at first I disliked her and was jealous of her because she was used to be from the popular group and I hated the way she acted. While I started to feel excluded and left out of the group. So I told my two close friends about how I felt and they completely Ignored my opinion. Pretending nothing has happened. While days kept going on I stoped mentioning my problems about the new girl in our group and started to communicate with her and hang out with her more often thinking then I would be able to fit in more. But as time went she‚Äôs actually gorgeous and an out going person and I actually got closer with her more than my other two best friends. The four of us are all having fun and talk together through out our last year of high school. Soon time went out and things started to go down. My problems got worse and I would want people to listen to my thoughts I try not to always complain to them about it and I would often hear them complaining about things in their life‚Äôs and I found it equal because that‚Äôs what friends do. But then soon I found out that my friends are once again distancing themselves with me. I tired to find reason and I learn from my past mistakes in other friendship groups until I finally said it out to them that I felt left out again. Then they finally all stood up and talked about the problems but it never came to a conclusion because everyone was just crying about the situation and ranting out all my mistakes and they never talked about their own. They told me they are sick of me ranting. They are sick of my jokes because it makes them feel uncomfortable and weird about themselves. But I found it really weird because they never told me instead blaming the problems all on me and telling me how I am the person causing all the dramas in this friendship group. But that‚Äôs not my intention to cause drama. I just wanted to make them happy and laugh so all my jokes are just to make them happy when they are upset and my problems I could not talk about it again only if you guys could of told me earlier. Instead of telling me at the end the year when everyone is gonna graduate soon. They said that my problems are affecting their own mental health and it‚Äôs killing them and they are sad because they have enough problems on their mind too. But I hate the fact that they didn‚Äôt tell me and I asked them that too and what they told me was they hide it away from me thinking they will get judged about their opinions on things if they stated their opinions on things I did or said and it made me really really upset. Because I thought we were all best friends and if we talk about things and if we don‚Äôt like it you have to say it out because then none of us will change for the better. It made me feel like a shit head that I am not counted as a friend because they hide their most important thoughts in things away from me. I could still remember that day where all four of us were crying our brains out. But all their problems were targeted towards me that I am the problem and drama causer. That day was the last day of school since the school got shut down the next day because of the coronavirus going on. So none of us get to solve or talk it out. So I send them each are very very important text message and explained my wrong and hope they would accept my apology. But instead they turned really cold to me and started to lash out everything on how I made their life‚Äôs horrible and things are never gonna be the same anymore. It‚Äôs a build up problem because since year 7 they would laugh in my jokes and told me that they would always listen and be by my side when problems rises and I know people do change over time but these words hurt me the most that my friends are leaving me because of me trying my hardest to fit in. I apologised for what I did in the past to create this problem. But they never apologised for the words they said or called me. That‚Äôs what made me sad and proud at the same time. That I admitted what I did wrong in this friendship even though I think I really didn‚Äôt because it was a misunderstanding of communication since they NEVER told me what they are thinking. But I can also understand them at the same time because it‚Äôs hard to tell one of your friends about this. I admit what I did and I‚Äôm proud of that. They didn‚Äôt do it and it‚Äôs ok because everyone has their own choice. It‚Äôs their Choice to do what they think is correct and in the end they decided to cut me of. They said we can acquaintances but every time when I text them like ‚Äúhi‚Äù or ‚Äúhow are you‚Äù they Igrone me or leave me on read. I realised that just some things that caused them to turn completely cold to me. I guess In the future I will learn from my mistakes and find a true friend who will understand me better than high school.,g1r9qq

I hate my family (especially my brother) I wish he can just disappear or something,6,"I don‚Äôt want to be mean or selfish but I think I am  now because I am gonna put it here about how shitty and nasty my younger brother is. On all the shit he has caused me and made me who I am now. How many of my fucking mental health are linked from what he had done. My family were always fighting and we‚Äôre very violent with each other so since when I was young. I had many bad experience with it and I hated home. I use to think I lived in such a perfect life. Not until my brother was born. His two faced since when he was young. He would show his cute innocent side to my mum or dad or anyone in the family tree just to get sympathy and love. While he treats me and my younger sister with disrespect and hate. He would spit on me every time when I get out of the shower clean. Throw dirt on my clean washed blanket thinking it‚Äôs so fun to see my reaction. Pick his nose and wipe it at me. Bite his toe nail and throw it at me or in my room when I‚Äôm not around. Wear his dirty shoes and jump on my bed. Mess up my clean laundry. Use his dirty hands to touch me and It caused me to have a trauma that my things will never get clean if I‚Äôm around that shit head and it turned me into a psycho clean freak that wants everything to be clean. Since he is the second oldest and is the only boy in the three children I found that my love in this family were gone. I‚Äôm the oldest and in the Asian family you were expected to do many things for the family. My brother was a little spoiled brat he gets money from my dad and my grandparents since he is the only boy so he is pretty much biased around the family tree. While my younger sister is the youngest so she needs more care and you could say I was jealous that all my love and care was all gone just because I was the oldest I had to work three jobs and the money I earn we‚Äôre either taken away by my parents to buy stuff for my brother and sister. I don‚Äôt want to live such a horrible life. Even words can‚Äôt explain my feelings right now. My brother he swears a lot around the house hold and my parents don‚Äôt care because he is spoiled like I said. He would always boss me to be his slave and he will hit me  or pull my hair whenever he doesn‚Äôt like something. He takes my stuff without Permission and breaks my books destroy my makeup and items in my room. He yells all the time and one time mum and dad was always fighting about him. Such as one time when my dad cooked him noodles and he doesn‚Äôt like it and he started to throw a tantrum mum came and started to yell at my dad because of a cup of noodle on how my brother didn‚Äôt like the taste. Such a petty thing to fight for. That day I was the one who had to stop them from fighting and I was protecting my mum from my dad beating her. My brother is too spoiled and that time he was 13 years old. Still acting like a baby. When he was younger about 6 or 7 years old every time when he does something wrong I would get blamed for it since I‚Äôm the oldest and I would get hit and beat up. I turned suicidal after many beat up and harassment from my brother and parents. My brother would stole money from my parents and use it for his stupid game. He would take my parents credit card and type in the number and spend about $700 dollars on a freaking game. When he was younger he would stole candies from shops and eggs from our next door neighbours. He takes things with out permission. Every time when I‚Äôm sad I would take some animals home, such as rabbits and cat and look after them and put them in our garden.  My brother would harass my cat and play with it really rough and when my cat attacks him for it he would kick my cat. He even stole my bunny rabbit ‚ÄòPluto‚Äô and he will threaten me with many things if he doesn‚Äôt get what he wanted because my parents has his back. I would get mad at him and tell him to stop because I‚Äôm not a very patient person because I hate my brother since he was young. So some times I would yell at him and tell him to back off for all the shit things he do but then he runs off and acts all innocent to my mum or dad and I would get beat again and yelled at. I just don‚Äôt understand. My brother had stole and had break many things in this house hold but my parents just never gets mad at him rather think his doing is good. His never going to learn his lesson and soon he will be raised to be a criminal. Since he is the only boy my parents would never do anything to hurt him and he never had to wash any of his clothes or do any kind of chores around the house. Rather I had to do many things.

Past HS drama,0,"So a long time ago in high school, idk why I ever did this I was being really dumb and I regret and I can not stop thinking about this till this day. But I had 2 friends who always talked behind their backs to me. I told my friends that both of them were talking bad about eachother and one of my friends wanted evidence because she thought I was lying. One day my friend talked bad about another friend so I decided to record the conversation and send it. Currently this is the past and these 2 aren‚Äôt friends due to other reasons but the friend I recorded knows I did this and she does forgive me. However, the friend that I gave the recording to in high school, her mom is totally crazy and she emailed my high school teacher saying my friend and I bullied the friend in high school. To this day I worry that I made a big mistake by recording the conversation and it will later impact our lives. However I know it‚Äôs just high school drama and everyone does talk behind others back. So I‚Äôm scared that the mom will like show everyone or the friend that I sent the recording to will show everyone and my other friend will be affected and so will I...
This happened like 3-4 years ago but I still think to this day I made a bad mistake. Please give me some advice or thoughts.",g06k98
I'm at a crossroads in my life.,3,"As the title describes, I have found myself at a very clear fork in the road as life choices go. If I'm being real, I already know what I should do. That's not what this is about. I'd like very much to just lay out my situation, and get some feedback from the internet at large.  So the novel begins. My boyfriend and I (me:bisexual man, him: gay man) have been together for very nearly 4 years. The beginning of our relationship came at the heels of a devastating tragedy in the form of the loss of a my dearest and longest friend as well as the heartbreak of my very first open guy-and-guy relationship ending in me being ghosted by a long time friend of myself and my family. ""N"" (my current boyfriend and basically the subject of this post) came into my life through tinder, and we fell madly for each other very quickly. But if I'm being honest it was never much of a physical attraction, and in fact I soon found myself being the bottom (yeah we goin there) in my first real gay relationship, even after I fully knew for myself that I was a top and did not enjoy bottoming in any way. Add to all this that my boyfriend was immediately both very possessive, needy and demanding, as well as having an SEVERE anger management issue. For the first 2 or so years he would regularly explode on me, often threatening or actually committing some form of violence on me (pushing, kicking, etc.). Eventually I found my backbone,  kicked back, and things got better. I told him I am not and will never be a bottom, and with that and many other concessions, we eventually found ourselves in a relatively happy, healthy relationship. Until time happened. As we went along, I began to become less and less interested in my partner sexually, and more and more irritated with the way he treated me. Cut to us 3.5 years in, we have managed to stay together but not without at least 3 official break ups in the intervening time. At this point,I love my partner very much, and I want him to be in my life, but I know all too well that I can't spend forever with him, and since he moved his best friend in with us a couple months ago I know for a fact that we've both felt that things are not right and we may be headed in different directions. But then we ignore that ""fight"" and a month later here we are, he spends every moment not at work hangin with his friend in the living room while I hang in our room. I'm just not that social due to my anxiety disorder and I know he'd say I should just hang out there with him but I don't think its crazy for me to say ""hey, I'd rather be in my comfortable lil space and have you hang with me every once in a while there than go sit in the living room awkwardly while you guys chat it up and giggle about inside jokes."" His BF isn't my BF, and I feel like I'm losing a battle that I don't even want to fight. Any and all feedback is appreciated.",fyy9yh

A problem I had for two years,3,"Before I went into middleschool, I was a happy little kid that would always talk to others and make goofy and funny things to make others laugh. Some of the kids that I mess with don't really have a problem with me and sometimes would ask me if I would like to play games in the playground like the floor is lava, tag, and hide n seek. Other kids however (that were mostly girls), saw me as a annoying kid who does dumb things and doesn't know any better. So the girls rarely ever talked to me. Sometimes I would be arguing with some girls since they would act defensive and would sometimes tease for the things I do. Luckily I had a very nice teacher and would diffuse the situation quickly. The girls will sometimes tease me for the things, but it didn't really bother me since me and my friend would always laugh it off. But then, once my elementary days were over and I had to go a middle school for the first time, things got pretty bad.

Once my first day of middle school began, I was sort of shy and didn't really talked that much since my friend from elementary school was going to a different middle school so I had no friends to talk to. My first impression to my classmates wasn't that good, I acted pretty retarded to them as of what I've done to make kids in my elementary school laugh. Once lunch began,
I sat in a small table were couple of my classmates were sitting in. I attempt to make ""funny"" things that I deeply regret doing like eating things of the floor, eating
scraps of food that my classmates didn't want, and make weird jokes that weren't really funny at all. Worst part about my classmates was that some of them were girls that were from my elementary school. The girls didn't really like me at all and started spreading rumors about me that would later destroy my reputation with my classmates. Another bad thing about my classmates is a small group of ghetto kids that weren't really nice to others. Once they heard about the rumors, they pretty much started tormenting me everyday calling me names, stealing some of my belongings, and even sometimes threatening me that they were gonna beat me up. I felt powerless because of them. Around the middle of the school year, everyone was pretty much against me, they all pretended I had some disease which they called Ebola and started physically distancing themselves from me, pretty much causing me to be lonely for the rest of the school year. It gotten so bad to a point where everytime
I sit near to ant of my class, they would scooch away from me or tell to please sit somewhere else. I would also pretend I was sleeping on the table while in reality I was quietly sobbing from all this torment I had to deal
with every day. Onetime one of the ghetto kids was mad at me for something that I can't remember and started calling names and other bs at me. I then snapped and threw a small milk carton at him and it hit him in his. After this, he told me that me and him are going to fight in bathroom. I was pretty mad at him so I pretty much shrugged it off. Then when my class period started he came to my table and told to follow him into the bathroom. I knew what he was doing so told him no. Then he brought his friend and tried to encourage me to follow him to the bathroom. I got angry at him and quietly threw a cuss word at him. He heard me though, and got pissed off and decided to shove my workbook off my desk. Luckily my teacher finally realizes whats going and stopped the ghetto kid from harassing me. But at that point, I hit my breaking point and started sobbing onto the desk. That day was the day were my personality started to drastically change. After my school uear was finally over and I moved on to 7th grade. I was no longer that happy kid that would always attempt to make funny jokes to make other people laugh. I was now just some kid that barely talked to other.

As of writing this now, Im now a lot more energetic than before and now have friends that I would sometimes talk. But I still don't talk that much to others since I fear that they would gonna tell me to shut up or say that they don't care what im talking. Sometimes though, I would fight off my anxiety by telling myself that if they don't care about the things I say, then just move on and say something else. I would also have these episodes where my confidence to do anything just goes down the drain and their will voices of my classmates in my head telling that whatever I was doing is dumb or tell me that my opinions are dumb.

Sorry you had to hear my long ass sob story about me. Hopefully some of yall can give some advice to deal with my anxiety and these episodes I have.",fxkty1
An Idea for a single shot slasher film,0,"An elderly lady pulling her suitcase by its handle approaches the sergeant at the front desk of a police station. She waits until he notices her and asks how he can help her.
She replies ""I have been having a problem with the neighbourhood kids."" She drops her beheaded dead cat on the counter. ""They killed my cat and forced me out of my house.""

The film then plays in reverse following her backwards down the street past the crowds of people going about their lives back through alley ways where she is avoided even by violent criminals and eventually we get to her house now on fire. She enters the house which exploded in flames in reverse. We follow her to a kitchen where she puts food wrapped in newspaper into the suitcase from the countertop. We follow her out of the kitchen where she closet where she retrieved her suitcase. We follow her back to the kitchen where she chops up fresh meat into cuts and wraps them up in newspaper.
She carries meat from the kitchen backward down into a cellar where she dismembers bodies of teenagers fighting them to the death with a meat cleaver who she finds have broken in through a cellar window and are searching for things to take.",rauju0
Collective Bargaining For Prescription Medications / Improve Med Prices,3,"Medication prices are increasing to levels that are not sustainable.  In an ideal world, people come together and negotiate the best prices.  Insurances should be that vehicle and should negotiate better prices for its customers.

But with the current legislation and the allowance of rebates, coupon cards, pharmacy benefit managers, and hidden prices from the end customers, patients are actually seeing higher prices with their insurance copays than what they would pay for if they just paid cash.  Many times people don't know this either (lack of price transparency).  Now this isn't always the case and is dependent on one's insurance plan but this is becoming more of an issue as more people are being pushed into high deductible insurance plans.

My app idea would be for individuals to collectively group together and to purchase mail order prescription medications.

* Groups of patients would join together by prescription medication with individual unit requests (ex: 4 novolog insulin pens)
* Prescriptions would be verified by their physician.
* Pharmacies and/or manufacturers (only licensed and registered medication distributers allowed) would bid on servicing the group's orders - like a tendering for the orders.
* A ""reverse auction"" at regular intervals (ex: every 2 weeks or once a month, depending on demand) would occur where the pharmacy with the lowest bidding price wins servicing the orders. The orders would be mailed to the customers and patients can fill their prescriptions.

Initial Pros/Cons:

* Patients may have to wait longer for their orders to be processed but this would group customers together to collectively bargain for the best prices. If they need the medications sooner, a local pharmacy in today's traditional model can service them better.
* This makes sense for patients who need **scheduled** medications for **long** periods of time. A medication that is of short duration or an urgent need would be better serviced at an individual's local pharmacy
* This would allow individuals to get the cheapest cash prices and even be able to go back to their insurance and submit a claim for coverage, although coverage would ultimately be determined by their insurance and may be denied. In that case, the patient is not using their insurance (or contributing to their deductible) like GoodRx's model.
* This would expose hidden prices of medications and increase transparency to customers and the marketplace.

Request: iOS app that allows you to use iPhone or iPad as Sony Camera monitor through lightning cable,1,"We invest a lot of money in our Sony cameras at all professional tiers, from the under $1,000 mirror less cameras to the big sensor cinema cameras. We also invest a lot of money into our phones and tablets. Then, we spend more to purchase monitors (the ones that attach to your camera, not your computer) that we can use in various ways with our cameras.

The hardware in our iPhones and iPads are more than enough to handle anything a professional monitor could do and even has editing apps that have a lot of the simple editing features that simple videos that only need, like Adobe rush or even iMovie.

In addition, the ability to use the iOS device as an SSD would be amazing too, as it would cut down on a lot of extra steps in workflow and create instant iCloud update. But with all that, the monitor part seems like something that should already exist.

Sony‚Äôs imaging edge app is insanely horrible with my a6400 and is missing some of the features that only exist on the camera‚Äôs touchscreen for some reason that many of you could definitely explain better than me. I believe this could be because of the camera‚Äôs limitations and the fact that it‚Äôs through Wi-Fi rather than wired.

Unionization as a service,7,"Provide easier routes to start a union, possible features might include:

\- Easy access to organizers who can reach out to other employees within the company and begin organizing without the initiator worrying about retribution (or dealing with work politics)

\- Anonymous (but still verified) chat groups where employees can organize without worrying about screenshots and identities being leaked to management

\- Report, document, and publish union busting tactics

\- Election petition filing

\- Fundraising

\- Connect organizers with marketing resources for larger campaigns

EDIT additional why:

Now that we live in such a politically polarized environment it's extremely taboo to bring up subjects that relate to politics or political identity. This has a paralyzing effect on the ability of employees to organize together and represent themselves. What are the current viable options for organizing? Walking around your office and asking everyone how they feel about unions? Sure, you could also send friend requests on Facebook to every single one of your coworkers but that has far worse consequences than simply being fired, plus you lose all anonymity.

Organizing is really difficult and not often a skill possessed by those working generally in the labor market, nobody should be left out of the benefits of unionization because they lack people skills, charisma, or social standing. By reducing the risk for employees involved the service should give meaningful access to one of our most valuable rights.",rduoge
Taskified - Gamified Tasks,8,"I was thinking about developing an app with gamification elements for a long time.
couple pf days ago i encountered a problem with my son who didn't want to do some chores and thought about this idea:

a parent - child app where parents can post tasks, each completed task rewards the child who finished it with points, those points can be converted to rewards that parent posted also.

some user stories i thought about:
parent side:
* can assign task to all of his children or an individual.
* can add gifts / rewards to be redeemed with points
* can track task / child proccess
* can assign a deadline for a task


child side:
* can take a task disabling it to other children
* can redeem points to gifts / rewards
* can earn predetermined amount of pts for each day (or maybe day streaks or something)
* earns badges / unlock achievements / leveling up

Open Source medical research without intellectual property. Etica Protocol,3,"Since 2018 I've been working on the creation of a blockchain *Protocol for* ***Open Source Medical research without intellectual property*** *aka the* **Etica Protocol**. [https://www.eticaprotocol.org](https://www.eticaprotocol.org)

Victor Hugo :  ***""Nothing is More Powerful than an Idea Whose Time has Come""***

I think the time for Etica has come, so let me share a brief presentation of Etica with you.

**Brief presentation:**

Etica aims to promote ***open source medical research without intellectual property***. It incentivizes ***publication of research oriented papers*** (by professionals or not) for each disease added to the network.

Etica protocol has its own currency Etica (*ETI*). The protocol has a fixed inflation of about 2.5% per year. Thanks to this inflation it funds the *curation rewards (for voters)* and *editor rewards (for creators of proposals)*.

It operates based on periods of 7 days. For each period a *curation\_reward* as well as an *editor\_reward* will be issued by the Protocol (respecting the 2.5% yearly inflation rate). For each period all users can submit *Proposals* in order to get a part of the *editor\_reward*  of the period. Etica token holders can submit and vote on proposals  using a staking system (They have to lock Eticas for 28 days in exchange  for ***bosoms***). Bosoms are a unit of measure inherent to the protocol that is used by the voting system. All proposals can be voted upon for ***3 weeks.*** *After the voting duration has been passed the Protocol rewards or penalises participants based on the outcome of the votes.*

The protocol is designed in such a way that **only about 72% of proposals will be accepted**. Thus due to open source competition the creators of proposals will have to **improve the quality of their papers** to get a proposals accepted by the network as things progress

*The  creator of a proposal that was accepted by the network will be rewarded  with a part of the period's editor\_reward that will be proportional to  the amount of Eticas that was used by token holders to vote on the  proposal. If the proposal is rejected, depending on the level of the  rejection the creator of the proposal will have it's stack duration  increased (for instance 65 days) or even lose funds (to submit you have  to put a collateral of 10 ETI that you can lose if proposal is heavily  rejected by the network).*

The  voters that vote on the wining side (can be either accepted or  rejected) will get a part of the curation\_reward proportional to the  amount of Eticas they have used to vote on the proposal. If they vote on  the losing side, their stack will be increased (for instance 84 days  longer) in proportion to the level of rejection.

Full details in the whitepaper.

***The whitepaper:***

The  Etica whitepaper (9 pages) describes how the protocol will operate in  details. (As Published and sent to the original Satoshi Nakamoto mailing  list in September 2019)

[The smart contract:](https://github.com/etica)

The Etica smart contract is on [github/etica](https://github.com/etica). It is a complexe **smart contract that successfully implements everything described in the whitepaper**  in the form of an Ethereum smart contract. If you are a developper or  you know ethereum developpers tell them to review this smart contract. I  have full confidence they will assess the quality of the code.

Etica is all about open source and **creating a community based project** **with nobody having specific privileges**.  Even if I started to work on Etica alone,  I understand the potential  of this project, it is much bigger than me and to succeed ***it needs to be completely decentralised from day 1***.

This is why I want to underline these facts:

1. I plan to **launch Etica in coming months from scratch as soon as there will be a community**
2. There will be **no premine**
3. Anybody joining Etica will have same rights, aka **I won't have any privilege nor anybody else**
4. It is completely **open source**
5. It is a neutral protocol
6. There is no backdoor Key or Key with specific rights
7. The smart contract will be launched **on its Blockchain (a Fork of Ethereum Proof of work)**
8. The initial supply will be distributed trough mining
9. **Mining will stop forever once we reach 21 Million Eticas (should take several years)**
10. Then only the yearly inflation of 2.5% will generate new Eticas.

Time saving bank card. Skip the faux security. (Idea),1,"Fast cash, Blink bucks, Dosh pass, Fast Chit, Skip Chit

I could make 100 of these names for a card that pretty much skips all of the questions at checkout and just pays mostly for smaller daily purchases.

Obviously first off Chip, NFC, and strip don't put my personal info on the card the limit is low and the security is high.

Skip the signing at restaurants.(Have a preset percentage for tipping you set on an app which can be changed before it clears. Blacklist places it's stupid to tip at)

Skip All the pin pad questions

* Skip the Pin/signing at check out. (Security features below)
* Skip the asking if you want cash back. (Just turn it off for the card)
* Skip the are you sure.
* Skip the do you agree to this fee.(have that one at the local commissary twice in a row now)
* Skip the do you want a stupid warranty for your 3$ bathroom scale.(Looking at you hellmart)
* Skip the donate to a charity (pisses me off anyway I'm not donating to your tax write off why is this a thing that I don't see called out more)
* Skip the receipt completely it goes to your bank. (From there it is with each purchase. Some places offer to send it to your email but about 50% of the time it doesnt pull the email from your card and now all the sudden you have to type it in on that garbage pin pad screen)

Integrate all your rewards cards (Google pay already does this and is fairly fast at walgreens)

Security features to ensure the easy card is not abused since by nature it should be blazing fast to use.All of these should be adjustable and optional features

* Every so often you must tap the card on your phone and the NFT re-enables it or even refills if you have a limit you are nearing.
* Location tracking

1. The card only work if its been near your phone in the last day or so.
2. A push notification if your card is moving too far away from your phone also adjustable distance.
3. Location based security levels highest being that it must be near your phone to work or the limit is reduced significantly. (So you can go in and grab a drink while you left your phone in the car.)

Initially when I thought of this I thought it would be an everyday card with a low daily limit that was fast but with the security options I've laid out this is likely more secure than mose cards. That being said some features to expand past the original scope

Online purchases

* Virtual cards for everything online (All of this can be done with privacy.com)

1. Wanna cancel that subscription but you can't do it online. Screw em the virtual card doesn't exist anymore also if they somehow try to contact you they say you died of  Pentapox or something\*^(Likely not legal) (Should be illegal to allow someone to sign up for a service online but not cancel with the same ease)
2. Same with utilities in small towns that go past greedy human eyes (my electric company compromised my card twice now. No idea if this is just a small town problem)
3. Kinda sketched out by the security of a site just use a one time virtual card

Aesthetic  
Totally pointless but I want it to be a nondescript flat color and have the Skip icon on it.Personalize it all you want just can't add pictures copyright nightmare.

Children's Shoes with GPS enabled tracking.,1,"One of the biggest issues parents face is the possibly that either a child will go missing, or they will lose them in a crowded area. Many parents have overwhelming anxiety that one day there child will be kidnapped, lost somewhere, or stray too far from home, never to be found. 

I have the idea of children's shoes, enabled with a tracker that can be viewed through a smartphone app. This app would show the location and would allow the parents to immediately alert authorities to their child's location if they are somewhere they shouldn't be. 

My shoes would be water and weather proof, as well as comfortable. They could also be used for elderly patients suffering from mental conditions that wander from time to time.

I just though about a Sound camera,1,"So it's exactly that, a camera but instead of electromagnetic waves, mechanical waves...

I can't think of any uses for that, but it would be really cool..

somekind of chamber made of sound isolating material. in the back, inside of the chamber many samall microphones that would act as the camera's sensors. and on the front of the chamber a small hole where any outside sound can enter freely: like a pupi.

conceptually it is the same as a ""dark  chamber"" or an actual camera, so Ideally it would produce images in a similar way

a problem that might emerge is the size and sensibility of the microphones. but still, even if we are not capable of producing decernable images, just a proof of concept os really cool! like the relative position of the sound source or something...

let me know what you guys think, does something like this already exists? (I would expect so given that this idea is very easy to come up with) and if there is not something like this, it leads me to think that the idea is just stupid...

why i hate him,2,"I don like to do this but im on my last straw. I can't keep it in anymore. My father has ruined my entire life, let me explain. I was once a young kid(not anymore im an adult now) with full of character i was funny, i was well liked and I loved my life up until 8 grade (many years ago) where i got into a huge fight with my ""father"" where he ended up  pulling me up and throwing me on a wall where i got my t shirt ripped I was only 13 at the time but that wasn't the worst part. If it was just that i could've forgiven him however my ""father"" then proceeded to not talk to me for a full year basically was neglected by him not one word. He muted me out. I don't know who does that to their 13 year old son I was still a kid. That obviously ended up destroying me emotionally and mentally. I lost all confidence in myself, I lost my friends, I became socially anxious as i thought i was a good for nothing since even my own father gave up on me, I also became extremely depressed and was suicidal. My chance of having a normal teenage life was done at that point btw all these he caused I am still dealing with them many many years later what also bothers me about is wich kind of parent stops talking to their own little son and how do you not think of the negative mental effects it will have on him. My life became hell at the point. The worst part is that my ""father"" never apologised to me about this as i was pretty much forced after a year to apologise to him. We then started being ""okay"" with each other after that however the damage was already for about 2 years we went on like nothing happened but i wasnt the same still struggling with everything he caused me. I decided to cut him out tho after about 2 years and stop speaking to him due to what he had done years passed. We still live under the same roof tho sadly as i cannot afford a place of my own yet. That's not the only thing that i hate about my ""father"" even though i cannot if he was mentally abusive when i was younger i definitely he would sometimes hit me a bit too much and would scream at me too much. Another thing that cannot ever forgive him for is that he cheated on my mom even though she does everything for him. She cooks, cleans and is borderline his full time servant while he sits and watches tv and gets mad often. So my mom gives her all for him and that loser cheats on her. The only thing he does is he has a hardworking job where he works like 80 hours a week but that doesn't matter as i barely any of the money makes and anyways i want nothing to do with it. He is a good breadwinner tho i can't lie. As of march 2020 i am still dealing with everything my dad caused me mentally my life has been because of him and i've also been suicidal imagine killing myself cause of everything he caused me. Still that the person that is supposed to love me and protect me gave up on me and caused more pain then anyone else in this world. Laslty, i just wanna know if any of you have good tips on how i can deal with this and what is your opinion on this situation. Oh and thank you guys so much for reading this and responding you don't know how much means to me :)",fxddak

People leave me and I don't know why.,3,"It's a long one. Sorry for any typos. 

Okay, so here's my problem. All my life, friends would just leave me, with no explanation. 

One friend I had for 5 years, and who was a part of the family, and my mom loved her like a daughter, left me to hang out with a new girl who dated her brother at the time. I messaged her yesterday (about five years after we stopped hanging out) and told her everything that still bothered me after all those years, and she said it was all my fault and that I must be on drugs to write that stuff to her. I didn't reply to that because she does not deserve it. But she did leave. 

One girl, I really clicked with a year ago, (she is my boyfriend's sister's childhood friend) just stopped texting me or going out for coffee. I have no idea why. Maybe I should ask her, but I'm nervous about it. I don't want hee to assume that I'm clingy or something. 

One girl, for whom I thought was literary my soulmate, changed her attitude when I got a boyfriend. When we started hanging out, I didn't have a boyfriend, neither did she, and we spent every moment together. About 2 years after hanging out, I met my boyfriend. She was happy, she liked him. About 3 months into our relationship, when she realized we were serious, she changed her attitude. I realized something was wrong, but I didn't want to jump to any conclusions. Then I got a job in a city where he lived too, and it all changed. I called her every day after work, and she wouldn' t ask me how I was, how he was, she would just talk about herself. Then we had a huge fight where she said that we're both retarded and deserve each other, that our relationship sucks. We didn't speak for a month and kinda patched it up. Now we talk every 2-3 months, sometimes not even then. I miss her, but whenever I think about what she said to me and how I felt it makes me sick. 

I can't say that I didn't fuck up some of the other friendships I had, because I can't stand when people sneak behind my back or if they patronize me. I'm not perfect and I don't act like I am, but I believe that I didn't hurt nobody, at least not intentionally. 

I don't know what is it about me that makes people leave. Do you think there's something wrong with me?",fwi9uo

Father issues,3,"Hi I‚Äôm Henry and I‚Äôm 14, I‚Äôll turn 15 later this month.
I get a pretty good amount of support from my friends and family and that‚Äôs wonderful. I really love everyone around me. 

Other than the other house I have to go to, my father is on surface level disrespectful to me, and is major subscribed to diet racism/misogyny. But when he and my mom were together he was mentally abusive and manipulative.

In recent years I‚Äôve shown him I don‚Äôt like him and I‚Äôm cold with him, showing no interest and spending no extra time than I must with him.
But this past year I‚Äôve developed what seems to be father issues. I‚Äôve gotten attached to one of my male teachers, a simple compliment from him means the world to me. He‚Äôs the closest thing to a father I have in my life.

Scammed out of money for a nintendo switch TWICE!,5,"I recently tried to buy a Nintendo switch of someone on Depop, this was through PayPal family and friends  and then I never received the switch and the person deleted the account which I later found out was hacked hence the hacker taking my money and deleting the account. 
I then tried to buy one off someone else on vinted. 
Vinted are a bit different where the money isn't released to the seller until I say that the item has been delivered.
This person wouldn't send unless they had the money so being as gullible as I am I released the money to them before they sent it, they have now also deleted their account and I have no proof of postage from either. 
It's pretty obvious I've been scammed and both PayPal and vinted say I can't get my money back. 

I'm with nationwide and I have submitted 2 visa disputes to them. 

I have argued profusely with both PayPal and vinted to get my money back and they said there's nothing I can do. 

Basically I'm asking if theres any likelihood I'll get my money back from the bank? 

I had no buyer protection with PayPal as it was family and friends bit vinted said my buyer protection was no longer valid because I released the money before getting the item. 

I'm out ¬£260 ( basically enough to buy a brans new switch)  and I don't need any criticism from anyone as I already know how much of an idiot I've been to fall for this twice.

Should I be mad about my little sister getting things without trying while I have to work my butt off for things?,2,"*sorry for bad grammar and spelling just wanted to rant about this problem I had that came out around an hour ago*
Recently since the new ACNH switch came out I've been begging my parents to get me one and recently my little sister (8years old) suddenly wants it. I kept telling my parents a bunch of reasons why she shouldnt get it for example she broke her charger for her ipad around 4-5+ times last year and also had a replace/fix her ipad a couple times during that same year. I also told my parents I'd they do get her one they would be wasting $300 escpially if I'm correct you cant get warranty and you would have to buy another switch to replace.
So the real problem starts about an hour ago tonight. My sister and my grandma(I have a bad relationship with) talked about the ACNH switch and said to her she'll buy her one with her money tomorrow and told my dad. Over course being in the same room as mu dad I overheard their conversation and got really pissed about it. Since all my sister had todo was tell my grandma to buy her one. While I beg for my parents to try and get me one. What sucks even more is that all my devices like my laptop, games, and a switch(I wanted another one because I am a big fan of the game and the design)  I earned all of those with getting good grades and honor rolls. So I told my dad it was unfair and he said, "" it's your grandma's money and you should be happy for your sister"" And of course I'm pissed cause ik my grandma hates me and I hate her (more into that another time) and my grandma adores my sister.
A week before  I tried to give my sister my old 3ds and a few minutes later to get changed she fricking put my 3ds back on the table and told me it was ugly and wanted the switch. I got pissed because I gave her that 3ds so she could learn if she actually wants the switch or not because I have and also for just 1 game. 
Then yesterday she told my dad when he came home she didnt want the switch then I'm there all happy because I get a chance. Back to present day all the fucking sudden she wants it now.

Is wrong for me to get mad her and should I be happy for her instead?",fsxpxl
some sort of place to catalogue internet weirdos,1,"i cannot explain why , but it is very entertaining for me to watch some random youtuber investigating the internet activites of these people , idk i guess its like watching a crime documentary , but the problem is : its kinda difficult to intentionally find these videos , you cant just search ""internet weirdos"" on youtube and get a satisfying result , you can search the name of the person in question , but you would need to know it first , wich is not the case most of the times for me , so the idea that i suggest is : some kind of place where people can catalogue and discover these curious internet dwellers more easily. in this moment , the only thing that i can think about where this idea would work is a wiki page , but people in the comments might know about other places where the idea could be applied to.

Bring your own characters,2,"So, I seen a lot of people wanting their original characters to be real, so I thought of an idea for that.


So you remember that one Cosmo toy, right? 

A little cute robot that learned from you.

so what if there was a think where you could bring your own creations to life.

Here are the steps to bringing your little person to life.




**Step 1.** You draw a picture of how you want your character to look.

**Step 2.** They make it into a plush and give it a skeleton.

**Step 3.** They give you something to help you keep up with it, it's an App.

You can check on their health, smarts and who they can recognize.





**Step 4.** You can give it a personality from 3 personality types.


Normal: they like to learn from you, overall nice, recognizes faces easily.

Stubborn: their dialogue is kind of mean, but alike to normal.

Shy: can't remember names that well, alike to normal.





**Step 5.** you give it a heart (it's what makes it function.) If you remove it, it stops functioning.

**Final Step.** and then you can talk to it, push it over, teach it like your child, play with it, make it cry.


Anyways that's my idea.",rkalcc

A Portable handheld gaming PC,1,"So my idea is to get a portable handheld pc, but with an external gpu. Which in theory I believe is possible. (I'm just not sure how much battery power the thing would need to be able to run for a solid amount of time.)  
But basically with an upboard squared, and a mini pcie to pci adapter, I can run a gpu on a tiny computer. And let's say I have a mini gtx1050 ti. Since both have its own cooling system, heat shouldn't be a problem. Only problem I'm stuck on is the size. I'm going to probably spend my summer messing with this idea to see if it can be possible. 

The outcome would be a device similar to a DS. And it would be far, FAR, cheapter than buying a GPD win or a smach z. (At most 250$?) And of course I can get a weaker gpu too! Since the screen size is tiny, no one is going to notice if the graphics are not the greatest. Of course the CPU is something to laugh at, but hey this is mostly intended for gaming anyway! If I could do it the way I want, I would take an i3 raizen or something and slap on a cpu cooler lol.  


Current problems I can think of:

Size, (How big is the gtx 1050)  
Heating, (How can I make the fan for the gtx 1050 unblocked while also making sure it's not in the way of something.)

Chip implanted in genitals to deter cheating?,1,"So you have a small computer chip implanted somewhere discreet in the pelvic region, and basically it chemically detects orgasms. And your monogamous partner would have one of these chips implanted as well, and you would set them up so that they would be linked. So every time one partner orgasms without being in the direct vicinity of their partner's chip, it sends them a notification.

Boom. High-tech trust enforcement. If you feel that your relationship needs something like this, that is...

Of course there's the issue of masturbation. But you could get past that by adding a heat sensor that verifies you're the only person in a given room when your orgasm chip goes off, that would stop it from sending a notification.",8ak4wj

Local Sports App (Find me a Court),5,"Hey,

The basic problem that this app would solve is that from my personal experience when I used to go play basketball in the local courts near my area, there would be a problem with the player population that day on the court.

I would usually have no idea how many people would show up and how many would have a basketball with them. Now I did have the phone number of a couple of people and I would just text them to ask but there were many other players that I had no idea of. This resulted in times when there were very few players on the court and and you would just waste time and not have much fun or there was no one with a basketball.

On the other hand there was a opposite problem experienced. I went to a court all ready to play and was welcomed with over 30 people trying to play on the same court. Now again in this case you barely got to play and it was a waste of time in the end.

There seemed to be a mismatch in the court many times, for example after playing just a boring 2 v 2 you would find out that the court a few kilometers away had 6 people playing and you could have played full court with them. Or 30 people were jammed in one court while there were 2 other courts that had barely any players there. Only if there was a way players knew which court to go to to enjoy basketball as per their need.

Now here comes an app which lists all basketball courts near you and you can expand the search area if you can travel further easily (up to you). So now you select a court and get to know it's details like location, court condition and maybe some recent pictures or videos of the court. Next you have the option to select that you are going to play at that court and at what time. Your entry will be recorded and there can be some visual that shows the players that want to play at that court along with their timings. You can look at the player details which would have the player's basic bio data and to make things more interesting you add your skills, what position you play and your physical attributes. You can mention if you play with a team or club.

Value of the App ? Now any basketball player would have a good idea in which court and at what time how many players are attending and this way the courts can be utilized in a far better way with people going to courts according to their needs.

FYI, I do not play myself anymore as I am busy with my job but I do think of the problem I used to have a teenager and think about an app for that problem. This concept can be further expanded to other sports with similar problems e.g football, hockey and tennis.",r6fqzm
An app to say bye when you die,18,"Hi :) 

First of all, sorry for my english, but I would like that someone roast the next idea and I would like to explain it the best I can.

I'm trying to taking care of my Instagram / Twitter / LinkedIn / Facebook / etc. accounts and every day I'm exposing a part of my life to a lot of people that, in some way, is interested on it. 

I made a lot of friends and contacts online (more than in the real life) and it's OK but... What happens when I die? 

I'm sure that it's going to be very difficult that a big part of ""my audience"" know it and I think that I would like to send a last email with my thoughts about life... or publish a last photo on Instagram... or send a last tweet. Don't know !

And here is the idea. An app where you can store and program the last messages that you want to publish to your social media or the last mails that you want to send. You should invite by email the people that you want to have the power of publish / send your last words, and for be able to press ""the red button"" they should send a death certificate.

What do you think about this idea? I have many ideas around it and I would be very happy to discuss them with someone :)

I've been off school for a year and this seemingly short period of time didn't make me feel good, --or precisely speaking it made me rather confused with my life. It turns out I am very diffident and hesitant about everything. I was employed in an educative institution and shortly enough I got fed up with it (in fact, that job was really boring and time-wasting). And since I resigned, I suddenly came to a whim that I would further my study in France . So I learnt French. But now, you know, had I persevered with it I wouldn't have posted a text here. I don't mean I can't deal with French; it's the potentially incessant barriers that made me do this--exams, visa, all other sorts of difficulties I would encounter once I got there. Perhaps I am not that into a high diploma from the very beginning?--I didn't know, and I definitely don't know now.

Just as important as the alarm feature, I'd also like the clock to be able to play an audiobook when I'm falling asleep. Currently, I just use my phone on the pillow which feels horrible and means I have to look at a screen to turn it off.

Wacky Electrical question,8,"Got a bit of an odd ask.

I'm writing a book. to skip to the relevant part, i'm trying to write about a hypothetical extreme cold weather suit that is hooked up with a jerry-rigged heating system. Pretty much made from scrap (Think Fallout) Basically the premise so far is I have a respirator system (think SCUBA) linked up to a powered heater that heats intake air for respiration and does not permit cold air into the system. It achieves this through a series of heating elements wired to a bunch of laptop batteries. During the day, solar panels charge the batteries. The suit (in writing) can last 3 hours on a full charge. Its supposed to be cycled on/off to recharge while letting the suits insulation hold the heat in the meantime.

I am not an electrician. I know this is cracked out.

Military and Luxury Planes that turn into Different Sized Hangers.,1,"\*Hangar üò≠

The fuselage *separates and the long halves spread apart along a track* underneath the wing becoming the wall of the hangar. This can even be done rudimentarily with a fuselage that fits together *with large jigsaw puzzle-like teeth* tightly bound together forming a seam running along its length at the bottom and *a locking rod* stuck through the seam of teeth that connects the fuselage.

The rudimentary idea for this is very practical for a minimalistic design. The halves of the fuselage open and run along the track towards the tip of the wings forming a low hangar, which has a prehistoric rock home aesthetic.

This idea has so many applications and tweaks:

Instead of the fuselage separating, legs can simply extend from the tips of the wings and create more of a tent, without walls.

Barn-sized and Hangar-sized airplanes might require smaller fuselages, but that's not problematic:

Implementing joints into the wings of these crafts would allow the airplanes enhanced turning capabilities by tilting their wings. Seeing a large bird aircraft tilt its wings would look intense especially with loose and fast hinge release mechanism, just like how a loose hinge flops around. This flapping and tilting causes the craft to look futuristic and intimidating! Seeing one of these in the sky would be like something you'd see in a movie, and with freaky lights too, it could be really intimidating!

Having airplanes that serve multiple functions like gunship designs or water craft, these birds have a lot of human charm to them I'd love to see come alive in both military and luxury use.

Is it possible to make this device like a thing that the TV wont work unless you are moving on it?,5,I'm thinking I want to make something that you can't watch tv unless you are moving like my mom is overweight so I want to make a thing where you at least has to move around while watching tv so maybe a sheet on the floor that she steps on and it notices when there is movement and if there's not movement for 5 seconds then the tv turns off and will turn back on when movement happens.,qq36m6

Would it be possible to vacuum your house through a combination of ventilation and air filtering?,8,"Or at least keeping your house vacuumed. Dust that has already settled down could be more difficult.

Was thinking about this because I live in a rather old house, and just just seems to come out of nowhere, which is presumably because it's in the floors and in the walls. If everything constantly gets blown around but immediately filtered out, your house will get an actual ""deep clean""

Also of course: no vacuuming!",qnztaa
"Bicycle Parking Kiosk (Reorganized, Pitch-Like)",3,"E-bikes are something that almost everyone kinda wants to use.  But what is the biggest thing keeping people from adopting them?

#THEFT

(Well, insanely homicidal motor vehicle drivers are a close second.)

You know in the USA, and many other countries, bicycle theft is a leading pastime of criminals.  Even though an e-bike can qualify as GRAND THEFT (just as bad as stealing a car) in most states, police will practically never bother with such a crime, making it 'practically legal' to steal and vandalize them.  Heck, many times a few parts are stripped, and the whole thing is thrown into a dumpster.  Or may as well be, due to the destructive methods used to extract 'valuable' parts.

There is ebike insurance, but how often can you collect on insurance, then wait up to months for your replacement bike to be delivered, just to have it stolen again?  So your ebike gets stored away somewhere, unused, where it can't be stolen... but why do you even have it now?

Your options are empty iron loops for you to chain your bike to, or nothing at all but what you can improvise to chain your bike to.  Nobody pays attention to bike thieves at all, even as they use huge bolt cutters and angle grinders in public.

Every second you're away from your chained bike is spent worrying about whether it's being stolen right now.

So, how about a bicycle security kiosk?  Give it a roof to somewhat protect the bikes from the weather, and gives the kiosk secure places to mount things, and with remotely monitored (over the internet) video.  Each bicycle spot has its own built-in electronic lock, with an extra-long cable to secure both wheels and frame, with video instructions on-site for how to do it.  Available in multiple sizes, from 4 to 64 parking spots.  Or just add more kiosks as you go.

Plus where these appear, there are one or more mobile vans that show up to investigate suspicious happenings at these kiosks, do 24 hour maintenance, and on-call bicycle service for minor repairs and transportation to qualified bike shops.  If something goes wrong at a kiosk, summon help.  Those vans exist for a reason.  Our cities are full of little vermin who destroy everything.

A kiosk parking slot can be locked and unlocked with the phone or credit card that you used to lock the bike with.  It will turn on an AC outlet over the slot you parked your ebike at, to charge it while you're away.  Buy a parking slot per use, or from a monthly subscription.  With optional additional levels of insurance on your bike, on top of ""we'll make it work again"" insurance.  Show your bike to the camera before you lock it.  Show your bike to the camera after you unlock it.  Or summon the service van for assistance if damage has occurred.

Every grocery store, strip mall, downtown area, mall, office space, public buildings, beach, park, etc. might have this kiosk, offering per-use security and affordable monthly subscriptions for peace of mind.  The foot traffic from the premium security might even make the regular public bike racks more viable as a place to leave your bicycle for a while.  

With the mobile app, you could get notified of disturbances to your bike in the kiosk, with pictures, AND at the same time the service van will be notified to check up, and possibly the police.  Within a relatively short time, these kiosks will get a reputation of being well guarded, with prompt security/police response.  Since imagery of the kiosks is streamed to people monitoring at home, as their jobs.  It goes 'beep', take a look.  Back to your normal internet addictions.  Something happened?  Dispatch alert to the internal forum about something happening, let the vans know.  Let the police know if it's obviously a crime.  HD video constantly recorded in a loop (similar to dash cams), so time before and after a disturbance is captured.

Better than finding your broken lock on the ground where your cargo bike used to be, with half a cart full of groceries.  

Each kiosk will have a small video screen.  For instructions, showing the QR code for the app, local ads, community maps, etc. and confirming/locking/unlocking slots.  AC power outlets over each spot.  A bicycle hoop and lock assembly, to secure the bicycle.  Cameras pointed in several directions to give an overview of the bikes and area around the bikes.  LED lighting to keep everything well lit.  It may flash or give warnings when it's alerting and recording.  Even if the screen gets broken, people with the app or cards will still be able to interact with the system to unlock their own bikes.

Probably the most key thing in the system are the service vans.  Keep the kiosks shiny, clean and functional.  Above all the appearance of active patrol.  One piece of graffiti on a wall attracts a thousand more.  Vandalism has to be cleaned up quick.  Police need to be referred to violations.  People who try to disturb users' bikes MUST be prosecuted.  Security, minor bike repairs and parts, kiosk troubleshooting and repair.

On the back-end, a VPN for the kiosks to live in, and some internet infrastructure for the people who monitor the video to report activity, and get the messages to the vans.

Lots of ways to sell these to a city council or chamber of commerce or people with some extra space in their parking lots.  They don't need tons of infrastructure.  Their own built-in internect connectivity and power.  Just need a little space, hardly more space than any other bicycle parking.  Provide a lit-up place for bicycles at night.  People on bikes are a bit more likely to make other stops on their trips.  Especially when considering the cost of operating an ebike versus a car, or maneuvering it into strange, new places.  The kiosks giving the public a sense of security to leisurely hang around restaurants and shops and theaters without worrying about their ride.",qnwam8
Feel free to read this!,8,"Okay so .... My mom is 38 years old and Im about to be 20 years old this May, my mom has had 8-9 abortions since I‚Äôve been born and their all with these guys she‚Äôs just met!

I can't do anything to make him STFU and it is a serious problem as he is wearing me down every night. What do I do?,fs6t3v
I don't have a voice in my house,4,"My family is complicated to say the least. From an early point in my life my mom did abuse my sisters and I, which really made me a quiet person even to this day. I always feel like I don't have a voice in many situations, and most of the time I don't. If a disagreement happens between my sister and i, I would also get pieced out because I don't make money or have a job. Anyways I got out of that situation with my mom which was extremely taxing on me, and I moved in with my oldest sister, kia, around the age of 15 or 16, I'm 18 now. I can't thank my sister enough for what she has done but it comes with a few problems. My sister restricts so much from me and even my friends can see it too, for example before this corona stuff happened, I've had to babysit almost every week for multiple times a week, for multiple hours until midnight or so. I would get angry at her but not say anything about it because one time she threatened to kick me out of her house, and I have nowhere else to go. She says our family is a team, which I highly dislike because we're more than a team, we're a family. I also dislike this stigma because she treats me like I'm the worse person ever at times and I'm a good student and I'm respectful. She restricts my video game usage, which at first I understood and abided by. But now she's restricting it even more and I have no clue why. I did research on internet usage on games and electricity usage on games as well because it might be a financial thing. When I presented Kia with this information she told me she didn't care. Video games don't take up that many resources when compared to cable boxes or phones and honestly games helps me cope with alot of the mental problems that I have, and helps me actually become happy despite me overthinking, or not being sure of myself. She limited my entire wifi usage for my other sister, Quiana, and I for 4 shared hours. So school work, YouTube, phone usage, and game playing all have to fall between those four hours. I don't understand why she would implement this considering my sister's husband isn't even out of a job considering all of this corona stuff. The only enjoyment I've had so far is playing video games/watching anime for the short time I'm available to. At times like this sure my mom would beat me and whatnot but I wonder if she would limit my passions like Kia does. It really hurts because it's like her way of telling me ""I don't care about how you find your happiness."" The dream I set for myself is to be a gaming YouTuber funny enough, but knowing that my family knows this they just don't care about my passion for editing videos. It's really hard for me to speak up considering I was abused before and Kia dangles that over my head. For college I need a PC which I'm not asking for it here it's just needed for a film college I got accepted into and she expects me to ask my mom for it. I seriously hate my mom for the things she's done to me. Why would I talk to her? Why would I ask her for stuff like nothing's never happened?",fra83u

What should i do? What should i feel?,1,"My question is below the backstory 

Backstory : I have been in many different relationships. I had girlfriends and i had boyfriends, yet i have never been as happy as with this one person. I met him few months ago and we instantly fell in love with each other. We saw it in each others' eyes. It was that shine and that emotion no words could have explained. Then came our relationship. We started off really quickly. We were very atracted to each other and we shared many emotions. We felt comfortable together. So comfortable that he was the first person i ever fully opened sexually to.
After few months of heaven i started to notice that he wasn't feeling as good as i did. We talked many nights and settled that he is afraid of geting into a serious relationship. 
I agreed on not calling it a relationship then, and not calling each others boyfriends. Next few weeks passed calmly but then the tough times came... Coronavirus has appeared and we got seperated by 350 miles. It wasn't the distance that concerned me.
The day he arrived home we talked on the phone, he sounded much happier than with me.
I asked him what he felt like - he said he felt free. 
He was feeling bad with commitment and got scared because of me stepping into his daily life.
Tonight we broke up.

I really love him. He loves me too.

I can't be in opened relationship which is his proposition. I am a romantic, emotional and delicate guy.

I don't know what to do or what to feel like. I would love to try being in this relation with him, because i am afraid of loosing him and yet again being alone. At the same time i am scared of being hurt because of this kind of relation.

Please... Help me",foizri
A considerably intimate problem so please dont find this funny.,3,"Hey guys. Im M16. This is my first time in this community. I have a question or more possibly a problem. Ten minutes ago I just took a great warm shower. Then I went to urinate and got quite scared for a second as my urine was neither yellow or transparent, it was cloudy. I probably wouldnt notice this at first if the tip of my penis didnt burn a bit. I dont genuinly talk about it but as I dont know what this is I am typing here with a hope of getting a response that might tell me what is going on with my penis. I thought that it might have been a bit of soap getting into my penis while I was taking a shower, but as I said, I am not sure, so please, any help will be greatly appreciated. <3

My friend freaks out about the coronavirusüò´,3,"It basically took over our everyday convo. I cannot change the subject with her , I can try to talk about Netflix , no I'm being too irresponsible and she switches to virus. 

I share my news about my university plans , she says "" if I were you I wouldn't have my hopes up in case they don't open borders and you stuck here "" for context; I got the call from uni and they really wanted to meet me and asked if I'm interested. I liked their course and how close it is so I applied for uni abroad which is like 2 hours by car ( yes I live close to border ) and it just sucks to hear that she just shoots down a thing that made me happy and hopeful. 


I tried to talk to her, calm her down but she dosent listen. She watched so many news and is terrified she locked herself in her house and sends her parents to do her shopping ( she is 22 ). I told her she should take necessary precautions but not to panic cause it won't do shit but everytime I share my opinion she just says I am not careful enough. 
It drives me nuts. Any advice? I asked her if she has some issues with me moving abroad even if it is still 2 hours by car from her. She has driving license but is too scared to drive.

I also never got help from my friends coz they would just laugh,of course I'm 18 and I moved away like 5 months ago, 
My jokes are also really bad, when I get a bit nervous I turn really toxic and fucking annihilate everybody who talks to me,

Another guy (M19) from school expressed his love for me, he's in the year above me. Told his entire class how in love he is with me and how amazing i am. Went out with him to a concert once, as friends. Then i couldnt get back due to the public transport, and i slept over at his place. He then told his whole class that we slept together but we didnt?! I had to turn him down 12 times..
Now after a month of silence he texted me again so i blocked him and hopefully he'll ignore me at school. Oh also my teachers got wind of that and my health counselor made me have a chat with her because of my behaviour around boys?! 
And that i wont be allowed on certain trips and projects if i didnt stop acting like i did. Mind you i didnt do anything that dude told his class a bunch of whack things and now its my fault?

Okay so i'm good friends with two brothers.
One is M20 and the other is M23, i do scouting with both of them and often after were done in the evening we go to their house for a drink.
Now with M23 we go to movies, sail a lot, just generally hang out etc. We're good friends. Now about a year and a half ago i asked him if he was into me because he was giving me vague signs. And at that point i wasnt into him or anything but i just needed to know. Now this week he came back from a trip to America for uni and we went to the movies and finally saw each other a lot again and he started to give 'the signs'. The classic putting his arm around me, pulling me in close, cuddling, annoying me by poking me in my side or booping my nose. But only when were alone.
Now outside of being the brother of one of my friends, hes a good friend of my ex. :'(

how my whole school goes against me,3,"so this is how it begins.

im currently grade 7 but this happened when i was grade 5. this guy, im gonna call him Luke. we always played soccer with other people in my class and every time i have the ball most of the time (as usual) someone would chase you to get the ball and every time he come for me, he always pushes me and after he done that a few times i kindly told him to stop. he kept on pushing me so i was yelling at him, i even told the teacher once and she/he (i dont remember) told Luke to stop, and he said he would stop but guess what.

he didn't.

i even went to the teacher's office to talk about it and she was talking like it meant nothing

and he continued

because this was my first problem with another student that physically touch me. i told my mom and it kind of went like this (since im to lazy to just tell it in details.):

Mom: yes OP?

me: Mom Luke kept on pushing me at school

Mom: srsly?? push him or punch him if he pushes you again

(mind you i've never hit someone ever since i was in school)

Me: okay..

he pushed me again and the one time i punch him he falls down crying and in my class Luke said he could beat me in a fight soo easily, almost my whole class heard and kept on telling me ""YOU!!?? OUT OF ALL PEOPLE YOU CAN BEAT HIM??? DONT MAKE ME LAUGH""

so yeah as soon as i punch him i go to the office and when i do i got to the principle's office. she looks at me with some sort of death glare and when i told her she told ME i had to go to stay in the office why me???

i still get mad about it today so yeah..

this is my first post so i might not be that good",fflrzv

Girls make no sense: Case example,2,"I'm a sophomore in high school and recently and because I'm not a loser I talk to girls, sometimes, it's not a challenge. However something terrible happened. In my math class, I was seated with 3 other girls in a table group of 4. 

I've sat with them for about 6 months now and every day my confusion and deep annoyance only grows. Initially I thought ""Hell yeah 3 girls this is pretty sweet."" However I was very wrong, it was not sweet at all. 

I had always heard of guys saying how troublesome and confusing girls where and how they couldn't understand their interests and stuff, but I always thought It was just the ""guy"" thing to do and you just kinda had to say you didn't get girls because you where a guy. Turns out I was wrong, kinda.

So we hit it off and our table group develops a friendly group dynamic. So we can be cordial but most the time we are harmlessly being mean to each other just because. However then things began getting weird. These females could just start talking about the boys they like and their relationships and what who said to whoever and other mind-bendingly boring stuff. They could talk for like 40 minutes about just garbage. I realized they where the exception because other girls don't ONLY talk about or as involved in melodrama as these girls do. 

Eventually the teacher kind of gave up on telling them to be quite and only does when she needs to address the class or lecture. Math comes very easily to me and the class goes slow because we have a stupid class, and also they're juniors who managed to fail the class and are repeating. The stupidest people get to set the pace for the whole class unfortunately. So besides studying the girls, I've done other productive things like learn more code, learn more spanish outside of spanish class, etc. 

Anyway that's kinda the context. So the females, they're like a whole other species, they have very different interests, senses of humor, etc. They say things that are totally not funny and laugh about it. I  know it works both ways but I just cannot understand them. 

Now to get specific. I'll start with the best girl. Daniella, she's a transfer student from Spain, she stayed for about 4 months until she had to unfortunately leave, she was smart and nice and her problems which where very similar to the other 2 girls problems where actually interesting. She was mad rich, she had a legit silver rolex and went to a private school. She only came here to learn english and get grounded.  Anyway she's gone but she was great, and it was really cool to hear about the lifestyle she lived.

Anyway the next caste

Ember and Katy are both your normal gossipy blonde bitchy girls. Both just talk about boys and makeup and cliche girl stuff. 

Ashley was Daniella's replacement. I was very unsure about her, I was sad to see Daniella get replaced the day after she left. But it turned out Ashley was actually not so bad. She was similar to the other two in that she also was gossipy but she was emotionally and socially smarter. She was also very introspective. Weirdly, she extremely bad at math, even though I considered her the smartest of the girls. 

Anyway Ember made probably the least sense. She had this hearing aid she always wore. I kept telling her it's dangerous because now the government has complete control over one of her senses, and what If someone hacked into it? She would also wear these massive hoop earrings. I hated them. Anytime she wore them I would tell her how goofy they where and how they made no sense. I could fit my head through them. And for her own safety they need to be removed. She never listens to my advice though, I kept on telling her how if she gets near a powerful magnet they are going to tear her ear. 

Ember has been my main concern. She's the most hopeless. Katy is the most bitchy and puts on the ""tough delinquent girl"" act the strongest. But she is the most academic of the girls. She's not terrible if you get to know her.

Ember however is very stupid. One day, she decided to unlearn the rules of basic math. All of a sudden, she didn't understand how negatives worked. She thought a negative minus a negative would result in a more negative number, which it doesn't. However she somehow reached this understanding and had such extreme confidence in it that it was impossible to change her mind without getting the teacher behind me. 

That's when I realized I had to help her with tough love. I so began calling her stupid every chance I got. My hope was she would realize that she is, in fact, stupid. This way at least when she says something stupid, she won't do it with such confidence. Or maybe, after she realizes she's stupid, she will gain the ability to think about the things she says, and hopefully think something like ""oh wait, I need to remember how dumb I am, maybe I should reconsider if what I'm saying is right or if I should say it at all?"" 

Unfortunately I got tired of my efforts going unappreciated, so I stopped. They were also being very mean to me in response, even after I explained my motivations. 

Nothing major has happened recently. I am looking for new soft skills to learn while in class. I need a use for my time.",fevkvz

A poe (power over ethernet) powered cable crawler would be a great invention,1,"Not sure the maximum throughput capability of using power over ether net but could you build a small device on tracks that could crawl through hard to cable areas then retrieve it when it gets through and then you cable has been run.
The ethernet cable is plugged into the device and that is how it is powered. 

Any thoughts? Is it not possible?",3odcs8
App idea: Hybrid chat mobile app,2,"I know mobile chat application is a crowded and dominated space by applications such as Messanger, Wechat, WhatsApp, Viber ect..

App concept:

However, the app would be a hybrid chat mobile app where there would be a regular WhatsApp-like text message UI and also a virtual chatroom similar to what can be found in video games. The user can either use memoji (android/iPhone own emojis) for their virtual character face or select an in house default one (cartoon like). Since it may hard to read conversations from the virtual chat (small text bubbles with the option of expanding them) with large groups, the user would have the possibility to split the screen in half with virtual chat room at the top and regular text message UI at the bottom.

To make the conversation a little more interactive, user would have the option to choose a status (online, away, traveling, sleeping etc..) to let others know and depending on the status selected the avatar would change. For example, if you choose sleeping status your avatar would display as sleeping and so on. In future versions, the user will eventually be able to select among many different type of built-in (cartoon like) virtual backgrounds.

To monetize the app advertising would be used but in order to not disrupt users it would be displayed either on the avatar or in the background. For example: if the ad is for a clothing company, its logo would automatically display on the avatars (for the duration of the contract), if it‚Äôs a coffee company the log could either display in the background of the virtual chat room or on one of the props or make avatars hold a cup of coffee with logo on it.

What are your thoughts? Would it be something you would use? Feel free to shoot any additional features or any app name ideas!

Many thanks!",qv0ddw
App for finding other digital nomads and share costs,1,"Nowadays it's not hard to find a job that you can work from home or anywhere in the world. I actually work as a software engineer and traveling across Brazil. The fact is: it's not very cheap to pay it all for yourself: airbnb, food, tours and of course, it's much more fun when there are more people with you.

And for example, when you have to get airbnb and you are alone, you are probably going to get something not very good because the better options are more expensive. This is what i am going through right now. I wish i could get a more sophisticated apartment, closer to the beach, with pool, and other fancy stuff, but the thing is: i don't have anyone to share the bills.

So the idea that i am proposing is, and i don't know if people are going to use it: An app or website to bring these people together, so that they can afford a bigger house, or to contract cleaning services, maybe rent a mansion with other 10 people (each having their own room), i don't know. Since the ""shareable econony"" is a famous term i think i can use it here.

Resuming what i am facing is: i wish i could rent a big mansion, with game room, feel like i am rich and share it with other people.

Would you guys use it? What is your opinion?",qu3k9p
People App,5,"Problem:

* Nowadays we don't see all of the important people in our lives; friends, family and co workers. I used Facebook to see if any important events happened to them but its filled with ads and random posts.
* When we meet new people we don't see everyday it's hard to recall the last conversations. But if you do it shows that you care.

Solution:

* you have a timeline of important events that happened in your life: married, got a dog, bought a house, etc. you can share your timeline with people you trust. Data is never shared outside of your circle.
* Keep track of the last time you talked to them. add notes like 'Adam loves skiing' or 'Josh just went through a tough surgery'.

Value:

* Cross platform - works across all iOS Apple Ecosystem (we'll think about Android later): iPad, iOS, macOS, watchOS and maybe tvOS
* Uses local and iCloud database: everything is secure, you have total control over your data.",qtnynj
A way to transport energy from the Sahara Desert.,6,"The Sahara Desert is one of the biggest untapped energy reserves.

Mechadildo and Mecha Fleshlight,3,"Add that extra dimension to your porn!

An internet connected device (male or female) that reproduces live or pre-programmed movements, scaled properly to the genitalia involved.  Probably should be bluetooth and powered by internal batteries, with wireless charging.  It's something that should be built safe for full immersion and cleaning.

For videos, add a 'stroke' track, giving x/y/z/Œ∏/œÜ positions for the device to conform to, over time, synchronized with the video.

For live interaction, repeats/mirrors actions on both sides.  So a live sex act can be more fully enjoyed on both sides.  Make prostitution safe and private for both sides.

Naturally the device driver should check for 'safe limits' and user preferences for 'how safe' before allowing mechanical motion that is too extreme.  Can't have it skewering or ripping 'parts' off the person who is using the device due to malicious (or corrupted) input data.

From there, other options, such as optional constant vibration or whatever can be added on top.  Plus open (anonymous) forums for feedback and complaints.

Maybe deluxe 'doll' versions of various sizes with more dimensions of movement.  Also market some recommended lubricants for each.

Well, it would be a miracle if it isn't already 'a thing' somewhere.

Does need a standard track for MP4 and other video streaming standards.  Tracks can be added to most video formats.  So it doesn't necessarily have to be internet enabled in the driver software.  Just a video player that recognizes the extra data streams.  Something that could probably be easily tacked into Firefox or other open source browsers to get started.  More complex to get it standardized across web browsers.  May be something suitable for an 'app store' program that encapsulates a web browser to select multiple streaming web sites.",qjz3iu

Wrong place,2,"Well, sorry if that post is long. I got nobody to talk about this and I don't speak english well so I'll try my best since I'm belgian.

Everything begun when I was 4 years old, my dad work in the navy and was often at the other side of the world for his job. My mother work in a restaurant company that have a lot of restaurant in my country so we didn't had a lack of money to live, my sister and I had a lot of present every weeks so we played a lot together. I loved my sister a lot as her big brother and I even learned her to walk (she's two years younger than me).
But everything wasn't always pink, my sister and I are different from other people since we've the Asperger's syndrome (a form of autism). That make that we've a lot of difficulty to understand the other humans and can learn very fast when we want to, our dad has the same thing than us and he knew that we were like him when we were young. So he bring us by people who are specialised with child like us to know how to manage us but our mother weren't okay with that because she wanted that we had a ""normal"" and happy life. My sister and I were diagnosed with the Asperger's syndrome and so we passed some test to know at wich point it was.

Me at 4 years old I had an IQ of 130, my sister at 2 years old 140. She already could speak and do math and had a complete photographic memory. 

Our parents discussed about these results, our dad was very happy and wanted to put us in an specialised school but our mother was a bit horryfied at the tought that we would only study without experimenting a normal life. So our dad put my sister and I in an school with other child of our age but with an experimental program that learned us an foreign language very young. At the age of 5 we had a test to enter the next phase of the program and my father sing me in without my mother knowing it. 

When they got the letter saying that I wasn't accepted because of my hyperactivity even if I had the best scotes my dad phoned to the director of the program and said that the exam wasn't staying an hour on a chair but it was answering questions in different topics in an foreign language. After a few minuts discussing I was accepted. My mother couldn't stand that our dad was putting us in an experimental program like laboratory mices so they divorced but my sister and I entered the program.

I entered in elementary school, all my lessons were in Dutch except the French lesson. The other child in my class were all ""normal"", they weren't ""special"" like me so they learned slowly compared to me and when you're so young you're an alien for the others. 
If you wanted something you had to ask it in dutch even if we hadn't learned the vocabulary yet and the program was tough so we had pretty none vocabulary the first 3 years. And it so that an accident that began the real nightmare happened. I needed to go to toilet but i forgot how to say it, I was 6 years old, hypercative so I wasn't listening a lot in class and the teacher was very strict with me because she knew how I was.
Two hours later, i remembered how to say it. I stood up and walked to the teacher but in the middle of the class it was too much and I pee on myself. Everybody was laughing about me and saying that the alien leaked in the middle of the class. The next day the whole school knew it and at the midtime pause during the lunch some people 5 years above me made me dink pee making me believe that it was apple juice.
It was so that I started being bullied because I'm ""different"". In the beginning I tought that it was only little jokes that was normal between peoples (I knew nothing about social and it was really hard to me to understand, even now I'll turn 20 this summer and I have struggles to communicate).
I lived one week with my mother and the other week with my father, they hated each other and my sister and I, we needed to handle it (insults, manipulation,...). My sister weren't aware of what it was because I protected her as much as possible. She was my little world of purity and cuteness. Always smiling, fragile and pure. A lovely little sister with blue/grey eyes and blond hairs. 
Since she was victim of a rape... I failed.. I couldn't protect her, my dad was on a boat far away and my mother weren't home.. 
Since this day she lost her smile a bit more everyday, her eyes became like mine, completely grey and her hairs became more brown.
She isolated her, played less and less with me. Keeping the secret of her rape during years.
Since that happen I became more and more aware of the world around me, how people (even adults) treated me like an alien or a genius. I learned that well when I had an accident and needed a surgery that was 8 hours long or I couldn't walk anymore. Gracefully this accident also happened when my dad was in mission so the army paid the best surgeons to opperate me  because they were responsible for my security when my dad was in mission.
The years passed and the situation got worse. My dad and mother became alcoholic because my sister talked about her rape. My dad couldn't find a stable relationship and so living with him became like managing a child when you're 8.
I got bullied from my 6 years old to my 15 years old. I couldn't get out of the experimental program since I was too precious with my results so I was forced to stay with my bullyers until the end of my scholarship.
I became depressed at 9, went to the psychologist for 4 years but nothing worked and I made 2 psychologist depressed so nobody wanted to listen to me since I was a ""special case of young child with the maturity of an old man"". Some people even said of me that it was like I made the world war when I talked. 

My dad said me horrible things, that I was responsible of all his problems. That my behavior bringed all the problems that destroyed him. My mother was more gentle with me and managed everything so that I could have a better life, enjoying a bit my child life. For that I'm going to thank her forever.
But that didn't last long.
When I was 10 my dad met a women that had 4 girls. I lived a constant nightmare during 5 years. It was so hard to live that I tried twice to kill myself bit the both times I stopped right before I died because I tought that I must stay alive for my mom and my sister. I forced my sister to live exclusively by my mom and managed to make a trial against my father to live by my mom except for 2 weekends a month and the half of the holydays. 
Between my 15 and 18th anniversary a lot of things happened. Since I lost my virginity when I was 12 a lot of my """"""""""friends"""""""""" asked my help to have girlfriends or how to begin a sexual life without too much problems and how to handle it. I became to get integrate in the class and made my first real friendly relationships (at least I tought) so I learned psychology and how to handle friends. 
I begun to teach lessons after the school in an class near the study room of the school during 2 years, I helped as much as possible everyone who didn't understood something and I even went to some of them's houses around 10PM the days before exams to help them. I managed this, I listenned to their problems sometimes late in the night and helped them to solve it, I litteraly carried 20 lifes that were for me nothing but simple compared to mine and one day I fell on the ground after my day at school. I went back home, said ""Hi mom! How was your day?"" (I didn't saw her a llt because at this moment she worked 60 hours a week because we were 4 to live in the house and life became extremely expensive) and I fell appart. I made a burn-out when I was 16 years old. I stopped teaching in the classroom after the school and helped only one girl with teaching because I knew that without me she wouldn't pass her exams. (Actually she's studying to become social worker because I inspired her.)
After this my depression got worse and worse because my mother didn't stand under the pressure of her work and became more and more alcoholic.
My father's mind fell apart so I went back by him to help him. I graduated from the experimental program and my mother met her first love back. We moved out (I moved out at least 8 times during my life actually) by his house and I tried university in biology...

I think that life want me to suffer because I fell in love with a girl that was perfect, she listenned to my and the story of my life, I listenned to her and we got in couple. In december 2018 my grandfather had an cerebrovascular accident right before christmas and my exams in january. I move by my father because he lived closer to the University and so I could sleep more than 4 hours per night. Even tough i studied as I could but don't passed any exams. 3 month later my girlfriend lost two of her grand parents and by my side my father tried to kill himself, I arrived in time to stop him and he went to the hospital. I lived alone in a big house for 2 month, it was hard with the pressure of the university, my girlfriend depressed with the lost of their grand parents and my father in the hospital after an attempt to kill himself. The result: I said something horrible without noticing it directly and didn't erase the message at time (on messenger) so she broke with me right before the exams in july... I passed 2 exams on the 9. I was close for some of them with 9.8/20 but I was too tired.. Exhausted of this life and I said fuck off to the university. I had nobody to help me, I was and am alone since I'm born. Without anybody to try to understand me. I'm now learning in computing and programming since I think like a computer. A couple of days ago I lost my grandfather, he finally died after 2 years of dying slowly in the hospital. Everytimes saying to me that he suffer. My dad is always alcoholic, my mom have a better life since I left her home so I don't want to bother her with my problems (I already tried and it was catastrophic). My best-friend has his problems and I can't ask him help. My sister is rebuilding herself slightly. And me I'm carrying my whole family even if I'm completely broken in pieces. I can't cry anymore even if I want or need it. A lot of things have the taste of blood, my vision often goes dark and nothing brings me fun. I'm bored constantly. 

Here I resumed my life, I didn't tell everything. It would take a lot of time. Too much time.

If you read this thank you, it already helped me a bit. At least I hope it because I'm so stressed and depressed that I lost sleep years ago. 

This world sucks, I've been born in the wrong time or in the wrong world. I don't enjoy anything anymore and sometimes I get lost in my dreams of another world where I can finally feel peace in my heart and mind. That's the last thing that make me cry..

My Experiences When Shopping,3,"I hope I found the right thread :/

I would just like to say I'm capable of going shopping by myself. When ever I go to jbhifi the person who I often spoke to wasn't too rude. Some employees are straight up rude and unhelpful, but it was the fact that they seemed to know me and when ever I go to tweed city jbhifi they always give me a stare and act like I'm a f$cking criminal. Not to long ago when I went to jbhifi to grab something... can't remember what it was, one of the dudes there asked where my parents were. Like wtf, C$$t I'm 17 nearly 18 I don't need a parent by my side to do basic shopping, like where's your friendly employee attitude. This happens all the time with other things like not giving a clear explanation on a particular product and such... keep in mind I'm friendly to them always. In fact I don't go shopping really at all. The only time I go shopping is when I wanna get myself something legendary, or rarely go with my mum or dad or just with mates.
I don't hate going out but when someone takes control of me to do basic necessities it really pisses me off. Some stores have this problem but I'll keep it short.",fc8kvh
I Had a fight with my dad,4,"Let me lay it out for you all. I am 24 still living at home with my parents still looking for work. Been on and off jobs for the last year not in a financial position to move out yet. Want to be a full time writer and been doing well to build up a following, been working on my craft and decided to go to uni, starting this year. 
Considering i pay rent agreed between my father and I, and pay for my own rego, insurance, clothes, things i want or need, the only thing my rent contributes is food, electricity and water. I help around the house, do what needs to be done and apply for jobs still. He believes he can dictate what i can and can't do because i am in his words living under his roof and his word is always law. I believe that no longer applies to modern times. It is my house just as it is my siblings, my mums and his.
My dad, he's a boomer, doesn't believe you have to apply online, goes with '""call them up or walk in to speak with manager or call after the interview and do a follow up."" Thinks I have to be out of the house, believes that i should no longer be here cause of my age. I am in his eyes a financial burden.
Now my sister, she's a full time uni student learning to be a dr. She turns 20 this year, doesn't pay rent, rego, insurance, all of that is covered by dad as he agreed to do so and stated he would have done the same if i went into uni straight from highschool. My parents run a business and my sister works the small hrs she is given and hold tight onto that money. Spending it more on her GF than anything. 
All of this is frustrating as dad doesn't approve with my choice to be a writer. He doesn't approve of the course i had chosen, he's not supportive of anything i do, and throws back in my face that he helped me get jobs and how i should be thanking him and blaming me for cocking it up. I gave them my best, many admired that i got up everyday and go to work despite the bullying that went on and still he deemed as ""she could have done better.""
The argument: I clapped back at my dad, trying to lecture me on how to be an adult, how i should work like him because he chose to buy a business and do shit for it, he hates that i have free time and tries to offload more things onto me when there is no need. I have three younger siblings who do less than me. Says he's the only one with a job yet my mum runs the business from home. Stated my sister doesn't pay rent i and i do, as well with rego and insurance and she doesnt pay a cent. Telling me i should get a job, yet i have been applying for months, tell me to move out and so i throw back why i should, putting my foot down telling him he does not dictate my life or my sisters lives and that i do what needs to be done in the house, pay for rent and help when its needed, therefore he shouldn't have a say about anything i do.
In the end he says I'm going to get a rude shock and found out later he plans to make me pay for a sixth of everything. I'm not going to let it happen.
I am sorry for the long post but i wanted to tell someone. Its the first time where i have stood up for myself as my father has been controlling of me for a very long time.",fblmhv
"Every call center software can predict about how long the hold is, and can call you back instead of waiting on hold. Calling you back needs to be the default.",10,"I know there are more important things in the world than being on hold. But this is a problem that can be solved, and in fact has been solved.

If it's under a two minute wait, it can just put you on hold.

App for Gout & Kidney stone foods,1,"I‚Äôll try to give a short and sweet summary as I have questions that people may have solutions to. Any and all feedback appreciated.

I currently have gout & previously had kidney stones. Biggest change that immediately occurs is diet & water intake. 

A large amount of misinformation and confusing data, one website says eating x is okay when you‚Äôve had stones or gout, the second link will say the complete opposite. 

The more direct information (for my type of stones etc & gout) is to eat foods that do not raise uric acid levels (this is caused by purines) 

I‚Äôd like to be able to scan the barcodes of food, or just search (because a family friends dinner won‚Äôt have a barcode) something along the lines of my fitness pal, the problem from research that I‚Äôve found is that the data required isn‚Äôt included in a large amount of foods in the barcode data.

I‚Äôve searched for databases with APIs trying to find this information but no luck so far.

- What are other means possible for attaining this information? 
- is there possibly other metrics that can be used to measure if a food or drink is suitable for a users condition?

Multiple player matching irl. More explanation in post.,1,"(Edit. I mean multiplayer irl üòÖ) I'm not great with explanation but bare with me....

What if there was a company/app or whatever.... that teamed up with places like bowling,golf,Lazer tag or escape the room places so that we'd be matched with other players.

The only problem I could think of as privacy/duplicate profiles but that's what the main company is for. You sign up to the main company with your real info and then use an alias/username at the sub company's. If that makes sense....?

It could be used for making friends, dating or whatever. You could pick a certain age and gender to vs or pair with. At the end of the game you get a survey with options to rate another player and if you want to play with them again or share your info or whatever. Everyone would have gaming profiles.

A story set in a world filled with stereotypical fantasy and RPG tropes that explores realistic consequences and reactions involving these tropes.,4,"I first came up with this idea when I was absolutely hammered with my friends and some of their parents. My friends mom and I came up with the general idea, because I hated the fucking hobbit movies so much for what they did to my favorite book of all time. Obviously looking back on it this isn‚Äôt even really true, but I said that a goofy ‚Äúthe office‚Äù style documentary would have better captured the lighthearted adventure of the book (even now I think it would have been better than what they did with it). But we had a laugh and kinda talked about how it would be funny to see the dwarves sitting there being interviewed and grumbling about the shitty food and goblins and whatever else. 

So since then I‚Äôve always had this little inkling of an idea of a bunch of stories set in a fantasy world, but where it really tries to emphasize how normalized all of the ridiculous fantasy shit is. I‚Äôm thinking of things like how some ‚Äòadventurers‚Äô become insanely rich and even affect the politics of major kingdoms and states like in most fantasy settings but then bringing in the perspective of more mediocre adventurers and how it isn‚Äôt so glorious and kinda sucks and they struggle to get by dealing with relatively minor problems like the occasional weak magical monster. Maybe something about a group of average soldiers and the issues they have with coming face to face with horrible monsters and legendary warriors that have god-like speed and strength. A merchant who has to deal with magic being an ever present issue and trying to avoid getting scammed by wizards. Stuff like that. 

I don‚Äôt know if this has been done before, I‚Äôm not really into much contemporary fantasy but I always thought this was a cool idea.",ro4dkq
The Virtual Reef of Intellectual Property,1,"Cross-pollination has been mentioned in many studies as the way individuals from different backgrounds come together to share inspirations, motivation and support.

Arkbase can be viewed as a virtual reef where inventors, developers, and investors come together to nurture invention ideas that will change the way things are done. We help abstract ideas get exposure in a crypto-safe environment. What that means is all ideas that are shared on our platform are secured through a Public Ledger Technology (PLT) which saves every transaction in multiple locations and gives a public receipt back in seconds. This allows inventors to bring their supporters in this safe place to discuss the development of their ideas. Once a brainstorming session is concluded, a vote can be taken in a similar decentralized way.

Though voting can usually be considered a complicated process, services like [**snapshot.org**](https://snapshot.org/) make it easy and transparent. As mentioned in our [**previous blog**](https://www.arkbase.co/post/token-economics-serving-inventions) about token economics, early investors, along with inventors‚Äô families and friends, are the actual decision-makers through their position of the invention coin. They get to decide where the funds get allocated and what direction should the developing team go. Now the developers, or contributors as we like to call them, are a bit different, they have two ways to join the community and a lesser commitment option. They can either buy tokens in projects they believe in or work their way in.

Developers‚Äô compensation through tokens solves the inventor‚Äôs main current problem, being prey to bottom feeders. Getting paid through tokens means that it is in the interest of the developers to do a good job and stick around as long as possible. A CAD designer, for example, can choose to work for an invention and get paid in a token that is worth 0.2 dollars and then stick around and participate in the cross-pollination and voting processes that can bring the value of such a token up to 0.5 or 1 dollar. This process is unique to Arkbase and promises all with a stake in the invention of a democratized environment where every voice is heard and every token held is weighed.

Bringing inventors together with early investors and contributors on one public secure authenticated table could be achieved only after the adaptation of crypto technologies, PLT to be exact and Arkbase is dedicated fully to solving the inventor‚Äôs problem. With us, you don‚Äôt have to do it alone, we‚Äôll be with you the whole nine yards. We‚Äôll help you launch your coin, raise funds and get developers to work with you using your own token, we only succeed after you do.

I am looking for someone in the UK who can partner up with me regarding an idea for an app.,0,"The app is a security app. I don't want to say anymore at this stage. 

I understand their are many dreamers who think they have invented the next best thing after sliced bread, but I feel I am a level headed person. I think my app idea has a lot of potential and there is currently nothing like it. It definitely solves a problem. 

Any serious person would need to meet up with me. I'm based in Bradford, West Yorkshire, UK.

The app is currently just an idea. I have the general design and usability in mind, but it needs brainstorming, refining, and creating.",ry78fs

sooooo,0,"ok, so I had an idea for a reddit page called r/boredanator_3000. so the idea is that you can post anything you want. so if you are bored you can just scroll though the boredanator\_3000. you will never know what you will get so its a new experience every time. the problem is that there are no members. but if there where people, you think it would work out?",rya8np
