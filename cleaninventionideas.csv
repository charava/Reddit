A productivity app that feels like a gaming app.,9,"Why are people so productive on their games but not in real life. What if we can make an app that makes you feel that accomplishing real life task is as fun as accomplishing quests in games. And we do this by using the same gaming interface that makes gaming so addictive. Like seeing the completion rate. Getting alot of those encouraging sounds.

I'm not a gamer nor do I use much apps. Correct me if such things already exist. This is some random light bulb moment.",fyje3k

Weird charging case,1,"Yo! New on this thread, I have a school project where we have to come up with an invention, so my groups idea is that we have a phone case that you connect a power adapter directly on the case instead of having a long cable running to it, this as well as quick-connect for different power adapters for example if you're traveling and you need a different plug.

Gravity powered generators,3,"I had thus idea a while back around 2009 when worked at a wood shop and was carrying two 5 gallon buckets of laqour thinner. Anyways I looked it up at the time and there were a coupke results. One was a lamp called Gravia that when you lifted a weight it would fall and spin a rod that had an ( i assume) dc motor connected at the bottom and it lit up. That lamp used a ball screw mechanism to do that.

A company in 2012 had a website for plans to build two huge cylindrical holes in the ground that were some how connected to each other. In each shaft they would have a weight; when one fell it would create a vacuum in the other shaft lifting the other weight to the top as it fell to the bottom. They said that this was achieved with a special device that would ve placed where the two chambers were connected.

I am just throwing this idea out there incase others are interested in experimenting with it. Some might say it cant work or that the ones that do arent that efficient or practical, but just think of the early days of electricity and generators. First electricity was just a novelty playful thing then as more people began to play with it it progressed into the first generator which people had no clue what it could be used for then. All I am saying is give the idea a a chance to develope as we get our hands dirty.",eqwex3

I just think its the next step in battery technology. Hope that one day we have batteries that can go 5-10 years without needing a charge. A guy by the name of John Hutchinson claims he has created a battery that keeps its charge with a load for years, but im not sure. I think in a youtube video he shows how to make one i tried but it didnt work for me but then again im not very skilled. I have seen another youtuber named Lasersaber claim he has built them and they actually work. Could be that i used epsom salt instead of rochelle salts when i did mine.

Buses should be delivery vehicles too.,3,"So the ideas i'm hearing from places like amazon and UPS is that they want to use robots to complete the ""last mile"" and ""last 70 feet"" of the delivery process.  It got me thinking.

Buses are a vehicle that often run a scheduled route through many neighbourhoods where deliveries and pickups need to be made.  Theres also peak and off peak times when their uses can be over or under utilized, which becomes a large waste of energy.  They also regularly connect to transportation hubs.  There is also a need to increase revenue to subsidize and lower ridership fees.

So my proposal:   Modify a transit vehicle to have collapsible seating, use the empty space to make off-peak deliveries by smaller robotic vehicles.  Modify transit hubs to also deal with delivery logistics.  Minimize the need for a transit vehicle to only have one purpose, making it struggle to create revenue and good fuel efficiency during off peak times for passengers by allowing robotic deliveries to happen... Which coincidentally is prime delivery times as the recipients are most likely to be home as well.

Build a delivery robot that can navigate a neighbourhood from this transit vehicle, be transported in a compact, efficient and modular way, to a transit stop to a front door, and back (bonus if it can carry a passenger!)  On top of this..  if it can make store pickups it can help retail stores connect with customers faster.

The future of transit needs to take into account ALL of the reasons we need to travel.  Not just be a people mover, but a stuff mover too.

In the longer term, it can be modified to handle loads of a larger size, or for specialized needs, like those in trades and services.  It can even lead to more frequent service, or even transit with more flexible route determination based on rider and package destinations.  The technology is here already, we just need to put the right heads together.",ebr9ps

A penis vaporizer to eliminate the need to move to use the bathroom,1,"Okay Reddit, please, hear me out and tell me if you think such a thing is feasible or possible. 

A tube sized vape would be strapped to or suctioned upon the penis. The tube would be separated into two chambers, one a chamber to catch liquid, and the other filled with scented traditional vape juice or ozone. The idea would be that you could urine, in place, wherever you are. The tube would sense itself being filled up, and mix with the traditional scent or ozone to deodorize the smell and begin to vape off the liquid.

Once the tube had cooked off all the urine, it would vibrate in a pattern to let the user know that it was now ready for his next urine. 

Possible? Would you buy one if all you had to do was charge your penis vape to not have to get up to urinate in a given day?",dzjcd9

"A fully submersible, deep soaking bathtub or hot tub with a breathing tube.",3,"Think back to the cliché in science-fiction where characters are imprisoned, healed, or put in stasis in those glass tubes filled with goop or some other liquid. It’s meant to invoke an eerie or unsettled feeling in the audience, but sometimes when I see them, I think, “that would be a neat idea for a spa, where you can safely cocoon yourself in a personal blissful hot tub.

The first thing to consider for this is obviously, “how are you supposed to breath?” So you would of course use a snorkel that would be preferably connected to an opening on top of the tank, meaning you’re not fully encased and can come come up for more air if you need to, or climb out. The bath should also be small enough for a single person, but spacious enough so that you don’t get claustrophobic. It also doesn’t have to be see-through, so you can have some privacy if you choose to forgo a swimsuit, but there can at least be a window (maybe with a slider you can open and close). Also some lights inside to keep thing lit—ones that glow warm colors to make things serene. And some spa jets. They can even be in-ground instead of large standing stalls or tanks. Oh, and the water doesn’t have to be piping hot, but warm enough to be relaxing.

I kept Googling this concept but couldn’t find anything just like it. I know there are isolation tanks, but it’s just a few inches of salt water where you can only float on the surface, instead of regular bath water you can safely submerge your entire self in without getting psychedelic effects (or drowning in, obviously).

Chip implanted in genitals to deter cheating?,1,"So you have a small computer chip implanted somewhere discreet in the pelvic region, and basically it chemically detects orgasms.

Boom. High-tech trust enforcement. If you feel that your relationship needs something like this, that is...

Bee food!!,2,"Have you ever noticed during high pollen days, the pollen likes to stick to the surface of your car, lawn furniture, basically any metal surface in your yard. How about we create a metal disk that has a wide surface area and keep it in high floral areas. We collect the pollen residue each day (of course this would have to be seasonally made) than synthesize it into a nectar or fine powder. It can be preserved yearly and depending on if a nectar or powder can be given in a fake flower applicator or in a serum into a bee hive directly so the bees can consume and create more honey from the supplement and thus create a bigger output for farmers or more food for wild bees. Sometimes in the winter bees are active but not many flowers are around. This can help nourish those bees and hopefully keep the population up. Through genetic modification, after some study time and science application, antibiotics or vitamins and minerals than can aid in the bees and there hive can be put into the ‘bee food’, or pollen reserves. This of course would affect the honey made but it would be interesting to see what can happen. Maybe it’ll make a harmless honey that can literally aid an asthmatic with resistance to pollen allergies?
