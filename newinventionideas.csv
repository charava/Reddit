A productivity app that feels like a gaming app.,9,"Why are people so productive on their games but not in real life. What if we can make an app that makes you feel that accomplishing real life task is as fun as accomplishing quests in games. And we do this by using the same gaming interface that makes gaming so addictive. Like seeing the completion rate. Getting alot of those encouraging sounds.

I'm not a gamer nor do I use much apps. Correct me if such things already exist. This is some random light bulb moment.",fyje3k
New use for recycled plastic,1,Would it be feasible to recycle plastic into building blocks? Plastic waste could be either shredded and remolded into large plastic building blocks that could fit together like Legos. Blocks could be as large is a semi trailer or as a cement brick.,ftq9de
clean money,4,"considering the filth that is on every bill and coin we touch, I'm looking into building a kiosk machine that resembles an ATM for instance, where one can take their currency insert it in the machine. inside there's a steam cleaning process that can either sanitize coin or currency.",ftq6v3

Face touch avoidance watch app,3,"Need a smart watch with a connectable Bluetooth device for opposite hand that can sense when you are putting your hand to your face. It vibrates as a reminder that you are doing it (so that you can avoid doing it and thus reduce virus exposure during flu season or other times when a virus is circulating - just good hygiene habits too).

The wrist without the watch would have a sensor to pick up similar motion and vibrate (but would use the processor on the main watch).

Just an idea.",fg4fhi
Weird charging case,1,"Yo! New on this thread, I have a school project where we have to come up with an invention, so my groups idea is that we have a phone case that you connect a power adapter directly on the case instead of having a long cable running to it, this as well as quick-connect for different power adapters for example if you're traveling and you need a different plug. This is something we came up with a couple of days ago so please let me know your opinions.",f9t40w
sign language text to speech,5,"so i have an idea of taking the footage of a camera, lets say a web cam, that recognizes hand patterns in a way so people who cant talk but can talk through sign language and have them speak through text to speech so they can enjoy streaming or making videos",f25zch
bloody mary polarized mirrors,1,"maybe as a prank or Halloween prop or something

had this idea to put polarized film on each mirror and set them facing each other. have one with the image either cut out or something similar on one of them. so if you were to look at them alone you wouldn't be able to make sense of it. but if you were to look at one through the other an image would appear.

plausibility?",ey1ejj
Netflix glasses,2,Glasses that have a transparent screen as the lens so I can watch Netflix at the same time to motivate me to walk outside more.,es71cy
Cellphone case SD storage.,3,Kinda silly but basically what the name says. A cellphone case with several SD card slots for extended data storage. The case plugs into the phone and has an alternate charging port built in. I dont know if having that extra storage would be helpful or not especially with how much SD cards can store now days. Just a fun thought.,eqwley
Gravity powered generators,3,"I had thus idea a while back around 2009 when worked at a wood shop and was carrying two 5 gallon buckets of laqour thinner. Anyways I looked it up at the time and there were a coupke results. One was a lamp called Gravia that when you lifted a weight it would fall and spin a rod that had an ( i assume) dc motor connected at the bottom and it lit up. That lamp used a ball screw mechanism to do that.

A company in 2012 had a website for plans to build two huge cylindrical holes in the ground that were some how connected to each other. In each shaft they would have a weight; when one fell it would create a vacuum in the other shaft lifting the other weight to the top as it fell to the bottom. They said that this was achieved with a special device that would ve placed where the two chambers were connected.

I am just throwing this idea out there incase others are interested in experimenting with it. Some might say it cant work or that the ones that do arent that efficient or practical, but just think of the early days of electricity and generators. First electricity was just a novelty playful thing then as more people began to play with it it progressed into the first generator which people had no clue what it could be used for then. All I am saying is give the idea a a chance to develope as we get our hands dirty.",eqwex3
Instant charge battery.,5,"A batteries that fully charge in three seconds or so. I looked it up and seen one is being made with carbon ion batteries, if i remember correctly its called Zap and Go. I just think its the next step in battery technology. Hope that one day we have batteries that can go 5-10 years without needing a charge. A guy by the name of John Hutchinson claims he has created a battery that keeps its charge with a load for years, but im not sure. I think in a youtube video he shows how to make one i tried but it didnt work for me but then again im not very skilled. I have seen another youtuber named Lasersaber claim he has built them and they actually work. Could be that i used epsom salt instead of rochelle salts when i did mine. Anyway im done ranting the future of battery technology just seems interesting.",eqw87s

Buses should be delivery vehicles too.,3,"So the ideas i'm hearing from places like amazon and UPS is that they want to use robots to complete the ""last mile"" and ""last 70 feet"" of the delivery process.  It got me thinking.

Buses are a vehicle that often run a scheduled route through many neighbourhoods where deliveries and pickups need to be made.  Theres also peak and off peak times when their uses can be over or under utilized, which becomes a large waste of energy.  They also regularly connect to transportation hubs.  There is also a need to increase revenue to subsidize and lower ridership fees.

So my proposal:   Modify a transit vehicle to have collapsible seating, use the empty space to make off-peak deliveries by smaller robotic vehicles.  Modify transit hubs to also deal with delivery logistics.  Minimize the need for a transit vehicle to only have one purpose, making it struggle to create revenue and good fuel efficiency during off peak times for passengers by allowing robotic deliveries to happen... Which coincidentally is prime delivery times as the recipients are most likely to be home as well.

Build a delivery robot that can navigate a neighbourhood from this transit vehicle, be transported in a compact, efficient and modular way, to a transit stop to a front door, and back (bonus if it can carry a passenger!)  On top of this..  if it can make store pickups it can help retail stores connect with customers faster.

The future of transit needs to take into account ALL of the reasons we need to travel.  Not just be a people mover, but a stuff mover too.

In the longer term, it can be modified to handle loads of a larger size, or for specialized needs, like those in trades and services.  It can even lead to more frequent service, or even transit with more flexible route determination based on rider and package destinations.  The technology is here already, we just need to put the right heads together.",ebr9ps

Kill-a-Watt but for internet usage,3,"Having a flash drive sized device with a small display to show in real time how much bandwidth your computer is using at any given time would be very useful.

Especially when gaming and a program decides it wants to run updates and you can't actively use task manager.",e2zjuq
