a device to report emergency faster,3,"guys I had a concept, but i like it more to see it used in this world than make money from it, so I am sharing it with you guys. you know something bugged me. just imagine, if a lady or a man has missed a bus or something and is walking alone at night. suddenly gets surrounded by dangerous individuals. of course he or she does not have the time to take the phone out and call the police. so this is being a danger for many years now. so i have some concepts. a watch like band, with a single click sends an emegency. Or here is another idea. you guys know machine learning right. so we will study the heart variation of many persons in danger and install into the band. so even if she canot press the button on band, it can detect the heart variations and send the signal. i dont know if this kind of machine is invented or there is a very simple way on our phone and i am just stupid. what you guys think?",rbk63j

Would Water Powered Cars Work?,1,"I had this idea how dams create power with water by the water pushing the rotor. If putting water through a tube like putting gasoline in a normal car, and having a rotor where the water is going down in, It would create enough power (I think) to start an air tube pushing air. And having water go in circles with rotors along the loop.

Would it work? Just curios.",r8n7pf

"Launching a new product, honest feedback request.",14,"
In a nutshell- Went to take out the trash mid summer and was disgusted by the smell of my garbage bin.

Came up with the idea for an automatic outdoor garbage bin deodorizer.

2 yrs later after market research, testing, r&d, prototyping, tooling etc we finally have a market ready product and just launched our e-commerce.

Honest feedback appreciated!

Also, any advice with respect to establishing distribution and marketing would be greatly appreciated.

Thanks!",r7djry
Human catching drone,10,"I just had this idea today, about an electric drone that has the lift capacity for a human. It has an automated canon underneath it that can shoot a net large enough to catch a human (there are net canons for large animals like deer)

So if a person is in a dire situation somewhere very high, be it building or mountain etc. This can shoot a net and catch him, and if he is already falling, it can match the speed and still shoot the net and catch him mid air.  If the human is positively responding to the rescue, it could shoot a different kind of strap instead to hang on to.",r6zgtp

Cold weather phone notification display,15,"A robust but low power display (flexible e-ink maybe?) with a velcro back that will mirror phone notifications.  Something that I can stick to the sleeve of my parka or the back of my glove, so I can get an idea of whether it is worth pulling off my glove and digging my phone out of the inside pocket when it's -15° F outside.
Will need to be low power, because batteries don't like cold.  I envision a patch like the military uses for insignia, so I can pull the device off to charge and to clean/dry the glove/parka/etc. Maybe a fat hardware button (operate with gloves on) to refresh or dismiss notifications.

I wanna 3D chip/PLA printer.,1,"It should be possible to have a 'four color' 3D printer (P,N,Conductor,non-conductor) chip maker that uses chemical vapor deposition to fabricate integrated chips onto pre-made chip blanks.  Maybe more 'colors' for other specialized components, too... for a deluxe model, to integrate capacitors and inductors and such.  Analog circuits come in handy, after all.

I remember a few articles from long ago about someone doing something like making circuits with an inkjet printer, but nothing for well over 20 years since.  I guess those college students graduated and entered the workforce to pay for their college debts.

Anyways, you'd buy bulk chip blanks with pins preset and pre-soldered onto connection points on a piece of bank, clean silicon (or other substrate), and build up chips like a 3D printer makes other models.  It could use pre-doped/mixed compounds as 'wire' for the P/N junctions, metal wire for the conductor, and something else for the non-conductor.  These would be in separate heads/'pens' to be used for the various stages.  The machine would pause, pick up another 'pen' (wire preloaded/threaded) and continue printing the next layer.  (Which would be a nice feature even for pure plastic 3D printers.)

Since it would deposit vapor from heating/arcing/whatever the materials and shooting them at the chip surface, it wouldn't use any chemicals, but it would probably need some kind of vapor catcher for the gases being drawn out of it by the vaccum.  Otherwise, it would be 'clean' compared to the (sometimes) horrific stuff you need to etch with, to make chips.  All additive.  (Or maybe even just specialized plastics?)

So, you'd design the circuit, put it into the software, connecting up the pin inputs/outputs, the software would simulate, recommend reconfigurations and figure out the optimal order of printing, you say OK, and it starts laying down material, layer by layer, just like 3D printers do.

It would be extremely low resolution compared to the techniques measured in nanometers, but for 99% of things outside of cameras and computers and solid state storage, it really doesn't need to be high resolution, nor does it really matter being super fast in every application.  If you're a hobbyist or developer, it should be accessible and a lot more compact and affordable and convenient than buying bulk transistors and other parts, and playing with breadboard when prototyping.  Plus of course, downloading shit and making it for grins.

You could even have the chip blank anchored into the machine in its own chip socket(s), so it could be tested and probed from outside without putting the cap on or opening the machine up.  Though if you built it up pretty high, you'd probably need its own air tent, and a way to reach in and put a custom cap on manually.

When you think about space colonies and replacement parts, do you really want some crucial chip to blow out twice, and then wait half a year (or more) for a replacement you ordered from Earth?

Sure would be nice if you could print up a replacement in a couple of hours without stocking and transporting harmful chemicals.

It could also (conceivably) print chips in 3D, somewhat overcoming the low resolution problems.  If you go for something like 100 micrometer scale, you could still pack a million transistors into one cubic centimeter.  It'd have to be real low power, though.  (Minus losses for purely structural parts and conductors and whatnot.)

Even at 1mm scale, 1000 transistors/elements in a 1cm block would be attainable.  Or print some bigger transistors as amplifiers/drivers, and such.  So making an 8 bit CPU or SOC would need a couple of centimeters of 1mm cubed voxels.  Maybe voids for airflow/cooling, structural elements, a shell and various other things.  Anyway, when talking mid tower desktop PC scale, you could get a non-trivial amount of computer working by PACKING that volume of space, even at such low resolution.  [There are already open source RISC projects.](https://openrisc.io/)  So why not download a new computer?

You're not gonna make much in a day, just like any current 3D print, but you'll get *something*.

Of course, weird, misshapen 3D printed electronics would be fun, too.",r3bwps

Elagant Concept for a Simple Thought-to-Text Device! Feasable?,1,"The inspiration for this invention came from a friend of mine who mentioned the interesting and seemingly plausible fact that electrodes implanted in a part of the body such as a single finger could detect micro-vibrations when a subject merely concentrated on the intention to move that finger, *even when no visible motion of the finger was acted out*.

Now, imagine if we chose 26 body parts- say, 10 fingers plus some toes, elbows, knees, shoulders, ect. and attached 26 of these ""intention-triggered"" electrode sensors to them.

Then, we assign a letter of the alphabet to each sensor which instantly displays the triggered body-part/letter as text visible on a computer screen or on an Augmented Reality visor.

I think you can extrapolate where this is going....

The subject would need to be trained to use the device rapidly, of course, as if learning a new language.

But eventually, there would be fluency. Let's say the right pointer finger was assigned the letter ""A"" and the subject was asked to think the word ""Apple"". At first, they would think ""Okay, Apple starts with an ""A""... which body-part was ""A"" assigned to? ...Oh yeah, it was my right pointer finger."" Then they would not even scrunch up that finger as if typing a keyboard, but merely imagine doing so. Presumably, that electrode would detect the micro-vibrations in those nerves too small to even see a visible movement of the finger. The letter ""A"" appears on the screen or visor. Then they would continue with ""P"", ""P"", etc.

At first the process would be prohibitively slow, and the required body-part would need to be concentrated on intensly. But as the subject gained fluency, they would eventually reach a point where the body-part to letter process would become subconscious. Meaning, they wouldn't even need to consciously think ""Oh yeah, my right knee is ""Q"", so I must imagine moving my right knee."" They would merely think of the letter ""Q"", and due to their training and sheer muscle-memory, their right knee nerves would be subconsviously activated and ""Q"" would appear, for all practical purposes instantly and is if directly from their mind to the screen.

I imagine a very fluent subject would be able to think of a word and as they spelled it out in their minds the word would appear, possibly even faster than one could type it out manually, without the subject moving visibly at all, as if directly from ""Thought-to-Text"" (TM),

This device could have applications for disabled people like paraplegics or those in full-body casts, but I see it moreso intended as simply the natural evolution of the keyboard into something faster, more intuitive, more user-friendly and ""organic""/enjoyable to use.

I assume in a decade or two this form of typing would become the norm and physical keyboards would be phased out.

Also, as a bonus feature, the results assigned to each electrode would be user-variable like options assigned to buttons of a video-game controller. So, imagine instead of letters, each body-part could be assigned a color, or the note of a musical instrument. Thus, a visual artist could complete a color-by-number type painting with a ""Thought-to-Art"" Device (TM) or a musician with a ""Thought-to-Music"" Device.

Is there any logical reason this would not work with relatively simple and cheap technology we already have?

[Macro Idea] Minimal Visual Contamination,1,"Hi Everyone! My English is terrible, sorry for that.

So, the first part of the title consists on the creation of alternatives to known services. Youtube or Steam and even Reddit for example.

That are fully filled with graphics and colours or images and content icons.

Maybe they could have an option to personalize the experience.

If I go to Youtube for example, I want to search for a specific video. Not be bombarded with tons of images and colors.

I think that it would help balance the coexistence between offline life and online activities. Making both more enjoyable and healthy for people that can't do that difference fromr their own, with all complications that it carries.

I don't have the knowledge to do that, but I guess that if someone has the strenght, could take that idea and pulish it for personal gain and everyones beneficial.
