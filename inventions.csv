An App That Mimics Snapchat Memories,4,"I hate social media, I think its a huge waste of time. I have successfully been able to delete every social media I have asides from Reddit (bc reddit is just different lol) and Snapchat. The reason I have snapchat still is because I have had snapchat for years, and I have so many snapchat memories on there that mean a lot to me. I want to delete the app very much so but dont want to lose those memories. If there was an app that mimicked the way snapchat memories works, that would be amazing.

I would just download all of them onto my phone, but asides from the fact that it takes too much space, I love the aspect of the dates in which the memories occurred. For example, there are always ""3 years ago, today"" memories that come up which would be a feature completely taken away if I were to download them.

So, who's tryna code the next big app üëÄüòÇ",r0f06d
Wacky Electrical question,8,"Got a bit of an odd ask.

I'm writing a book. to skip to the relevant part, i'm trying to write about a hypothetical extreme cold weather suit that is hooked up with a jerry-rigged heating system. Pretty much made from scrap (Think Fallout) Basically the premise so far is I have a respirator system (think SCUBA) linked up to a powered heater that heats intake air for respiration and does not permit cold air into the system. It achieves this through a series of heating elements wired to a bunch of laptop batteries. During the day, solar panels charge the batteries. The suit (in writing) can last 3 hours on a full charge. Its supposed to be cycled on/off to recharge while letting the suits insulation hold the heat in the meantime.

I am not an electrician. I know this is cracked out. 

A) What are the issues and how do I plug them?

B) what would be another way to heat air rapidy that could fit in a large backpack?

C) What are some details i could add for extra realism?",qza0ka

Looking for new application fields,0," 

Dear community!

I am looking for an application field for a new foil. Imagine you had a foil that can do the following: The whole foil can conduct electricity and seperatly transfer information. You could for example integrate LEDs and control them individually, so you can use it for lighning or even make a display out of it. Another possibility would be to use it as an alarm system, due to many sensors that need electricity as well as information. In addition, there would be a possibility of power plugs, that could be placed anywhere on the foil. Furthermore, the foil could be adapted to individual needs, it is flexible and could be cut in any form and size. The individual elements could be applied as desired. You could also use it outside, due to the fact that it is very robust.

Do you have ideas or suggestions, where the foil could find use? Have you ever been in a situation where this foil would have helped you?",qxi2kd
A chill cap for hot summer days,1,"My idea is for a baseball cap with a waterproof pocket in the top with a zip. There are already small bags that you can chill in the freezer - typically for use with lunch boxes. You could slip one of these in the pocket on a hot day. Take a bunch of these freezer bags with you in your cooler/esky/chilly bin and swap them out when the first one has warmed up. Great for a day at the beach. 

I imagine there might be issues with condensation and it might be hard to get the cap looking 'normal'. Maybe it would be a 'cool' new look. 

What are your thoughts?",qxdj27

A tamper proof app that can turn a smartphone into a simple text and call phone.,2,"Technology has moved towards smartphones but unfortunately gave up on dumbphones. For conscious parents who want to at least give their kid an old phone to call when needed, but not get distracted with it or all the other shenanigans that come with a smartphone at the hands of a child, it would be cool to have an app that can turn such phones into simple text and call phones without a way to disable the app. Right now there are some apps attempting to do such thing (for example the freedom app) but can be easily disabled if someone knows which setting to change. It's probably a manufacturer design choice to not allow any lock attempt for system settings, but maybe that could be changed.",qsdsz9

Military and Luxury Planes that turn into Different Sized Hangers.,2,"\Hangar üò≠

The fuselage separates and the long halves spread apart along a track underneath the wing becoming the wall of the hangar. This can even be done rudimentarily with a fuselage that fits together with large jigsaw puzzle-like teeth tightly bound together forming a seam running along its length at the bottom and a locking rod stuck through the seam of teeth that connects the fuselage.

The rudimentary idea for this (above) is very practical for a minimalistic design (that doesn't mean small). The halves open up forming this prehistoric-eque low hangar that emulates a cave modern caveman cave home design.

This idea has so many applications and tweaks though.

Instead of the fuselage separating... legs can extend from toward the tip of the wing and create more of a tent than a hangar since this design doesn't have walls.

More Barn-sized and Hangar-sized airplanes might require smaller fuselages, but that's not problematic.

Implementing joints into the wings of these crafts would allow the airplanes enhanced turning capabilities by tilting their wings. Seeing a large bird aircraft tilt its wings would look intense especially with flapping using just one joint and the ""flapping"" occurs very loose and fast, like a loose hinge flopping around. This causes it to look so futuristic and intimidating! Seeing one of these in the sky would be like something you'd see in a movie. With freaky lights too, it could be really intimidating.

Having airplanes that serve multiple functions like gunship designs or water craft, these birds have a lot of human charm to them I'd love to see come alive in both military and luxury use.

"Is there an analog alarm clock that plays audiobooks, podcasts, and radio?",1,"I'm really surprised at how difficult it is to find an analog alarm clock that plays audiobooks, podcasts, or radio to wake you up. I don't want my phone to be in the bedroom when I sleep and I'm also not looking to have a smart speaker beside my bed because a) I don't really like the look of them and b) they feel way too connected which is what I'm trying to minimize when sleeping.

Just as important as the alarm feature, I'd also like the clock to be able to play an audiobook when I'm falling asleep. Currently, I just use my phone on the pillow which feels horrible and means I have to look at a screen to turn it off.

Does such a device exist because I haven't been able to find one?   
Do many people listen to some form of audio like this while falling asleep?

For reference - it's a similar sort of 'unplugged' concept like the OneClock but allows bedtime audio listening and uses audiobooks/podcasts/radio to wake you up.",r2l4mp
