Wacky Electrical question,9,"Got a bit of an odd ask.

I'm writing a book. to skip to the relevant part, i'm trying to write about a hypothetical extreme cold weather suit that is hooked up with a jerry-rigged heating system. Pretty much made from scrap (Think Fallout) Basically the premise so far is I have a respirator system (think SCUBA) linked up to a powered heater that heats intake air for respiration and does not permit cold air into the system. It achieves this through a series of heating elements wired to a bunch of laptop batteries. During the day, solar panels charge the batteries. The suit (in writing) can last 3 hours on a full charge. Its supposed to be cycled on/off to recharge while letting the suits insulation hold the heat in the meantime.

I am not an electrician. I know this is cracked out. 

A) What are the issues and how do I plug them?

B) what would be another way to heat air rapidy that could fit in a large backpack?

C) What are some details i could add for extra realism?",qza0ka

Dear community!

I am looking for an application field for a new foil. Imagine you had a foil that can do the following: The whole foil can conduct electricity and seperatly transfer information. You could for example integrate LEDs and control them individually, so you can use it for lighning or even make a display out of it. Another possibility would be to use it as an alarm system, due to many sensors that need electricity as well as information. In addition, there would be a possibility of power plugs, that could be placed anywhere on the foil. Furthermore, the foil could be adapted to individual needs, it is flexible and could be cut in any form and size. The individual elements could be applied as desired. You could also use it outside, due to the fact that it is very robust.

Do you have ideas or suggestions, where the foil could find use? Have you ever been in a situation where this foil would have helped you?",qxi2kd
A chill cap for hot summer days,1,"My idea is for a baseball cap with a waterproof pocket in the top with a zip. There are already small bags that you can chill in the freezer - typically for use with lunch boxes. You could slip one of these in the pocket on a hot day. Take a bunch of these freezer bags with you in your cooler/esky/chilly bin and swap them out when the first one has warmed up. Great for a day at the beach. 

I imagine there might be issues with condensation and it might be hard to get the cap looking 'normal'. Maybe it would be a 'cool' new look. 

What are your thoughts?",qxdj27
