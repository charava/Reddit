People who are clearly ill going to the cinema infecting everyone else.,1,"I went to see deadpool 2 on the weekend and the person 4 seats away from me clearly had a heavy cold or flu as was coughing regularly.

4 hours later had a sore throat which was like sandpaper for three days and its now developed into a nasty flu like cold. Cant sleep, no energy, fever the works.

To top it off i also thought deadpool 2 was a terrible film after really enjoying the first one.

If your infectious why go to the cinema its so selfish to spread your germs to so many people.
