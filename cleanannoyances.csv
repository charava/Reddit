Stop starting a sentence by saying 'worst case scenario',1,"A friend of mine keeps starting his sentences with 'worst case scenario' and then proceeds to not lay out the worst case scenario.

Example : Lets go see a new movie on the first day its out. Worst case scenario, its sold out and we see something else. 

No David, that is not the worst case scenario. Worst case scenario, we drive off the road and both die on the way to the theatre. Worst case scenario, an exceptionally large solar flare occurs which first knocks out all electricity on the planet and then a subsequent flare burns the surface of the earth and kills off everyone who wasn't subterranean at the time. WORST CASE SCENARIO everything you know and love dies horrible deaths in front of your eyes and you're left alone wandering the earth looking for other survivors haunted by the memory of your loved ones last moments.

- extremely homophobic
- alarmingly racist
- can't write a single comment without a swearword in it
- stupid
- naive
- sexist

Is there any peer who feels mixed-up about his life?,2,"Hello, I'm Casper, 22 years old. I've been off school for a year and this seemingly short period of time didn't make me feel good, --or precisely speaking it made me rather confused with my life. It turns out I am very diffident and hesitant about everything. I was employed in an educative institution and shortly enough I got fed up with it (in fact, that job was really boring and time-wasting). And since I resigned, I suddenly came to a whim that I would further my study in France . So I learnt French. But now, you know, had I persevered with it I wouldn't have posted a text here. I don't mean I can't deal with French; it's the potentially incessant barriers that made me do this--exams, visa, all other sorts of difficulties I would encounter once I got there. Perhaps I am not that into a high diploma from the very beginning?--I didn't know, and I definitely don't know now. 

So if I were lucky enough that my nonsense would be seen, would you guys give me some advice or simply your opinions or whatever? I would be rather thankful. :-)",4jjzt3
