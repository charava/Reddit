a device to report emergency faster,3,"guys I had a concept, but i like it more to see it used in this world than make money from it, so I am sharing it with you guys. you know something bugged me. just imagine, if a lady or a man has missed a bus or something and is walking alone at night. suddenly gets surrounded by dangerous individuals. of course he or she does not have the time to take the phone out and call the police. so this is being a danger for many years now. so i have some concepts. a watch like band, with a single click sends an emegency. Or here is another idea. you guys know machine learning right. so we will study the heart variation of many persons in danger and install into the band. so even if she canot press the button on band, it can detect the heart variations and send the signal. i dont know if this kind of machine is invented or there is a very simple way on our phone and i am just stupid. what you guys think?",rbk63j

I wanna 3D chip/PLA printer.,1,"It should be possible to have a 'four color' 3D printer (P,N,Conductor,non-conductor) chip maker that uses chemical vapor deposition to fabricate integrated chips onto pre-made chip blanks.  Maybe more 'colors' for other specialized components, too... for a deluxe model, to integrate capacitors and inductors and such.  Analog circuits come in handy, after all.

I remember a few articles from long ago about someone doing something like making circuits with an inkjet printer, but nothing for well over 20 years since.  I guess those college students graduated and entered the workforce to pay for their college debts.

Anyways, you'd buy bulk chip blanks with pins preset and pre-soldered onto connection points on a piece of bank, clean silicon (or other substrate), and build up chips like a 3D printer makes other models.  It could use pre-doped/mixed compounds as 'wire' for the P/N junctions, metal wire for the conductor, and something else for the non-conductor.  These would be in separate heads/'pens' to be used for the various stages.  The machine would pause, pick up another 'pen' (wire preloaded/threaded) and continue printing the next layer.  (Which would be a nice feature even for pure plastic 3D printers.)

Since it would deposit vapor from heating/arcing/whatever the materials and shooting them at the chip surface, it wouldn't use any chemicals, but it would probably need some kind of vapor catcher for the gases being drawn out of it by the vaccum.  Otherwise, it would be 'clean' compared to the (sometimes) horrific stuff you need to etch with, to make chips.  All additive.  (Or maybe even just specialized plastics?)

So, you'd design the circuit, put it into the software, connecting up the pin inputs/outputs, the software would simulate, recommend reconfigurations and figure out the optimal order of printing, you say OK, and it starts laying down material, layer by layer, just like 3D printers do.

It would be extremely low resolution compared to the techniques measured in nanometers, but for 99% of things outside of cameras and computers and solid state storage, it really doesn't need to be high resolution, nor does it really matter being super fast in every application.  If you're a hobbyist or developer, it should be accessible and a lot more compact and affordable and convenient than buying bulk transistors and other parts, and playing with breadboard when prototyping.  Plus of course, downloading shit and making it for grins.

You could even have the chip blank anchored into the machine in its own chip socket(s), so it could be tested and probed from outside without putting the cap on or opening the machine up.  Though if you built it up pretty high, you'd probably need its own air tent, and a way to reach in and put a custom cap on manually.

When you think about space colonies and replacement parts, do you really want some crucial chip to blow out twice, and then wait half a year (or more) for a replacement you ordered from Earth?

Sure would be nice if you could print up a replacement in a couple of hours without stocking and transporting harmful chemicals.

It could also (conceivably) print chips in 3D, somewhat overcoming the low resolution problems.  If you go for something like 100 micrometer scale, you could still pack a million transistors into one cubic centimeter.  It'd have to be real low power, though.  (Minus losses for purely structural parts and conductors and whatnot.)

Even at 1mm scale, 1000 transistors/elements in a 1cm block would be attainable.  Or print some bigger transistors as amplifiers/drivers, and such.  So making an 8 bit CPU or SOC would need a couple of centimeters of 1mm cubed voxels.  Maybe voids for airflow/cooling, structural elements, a shell and various other things.  Anyway, when talking mid tower desktop PC scale, you could get a non-trivial amount of computer working by PACKING that volume of space, even at such low resolution.  [There are already open source RISC projects.](https://openrisc.io/)  So why not download a new computer?

You're not gonna make much in a day, just like any current 3D print, but you'll get something.

Of course, weird, misshapen 3D printed electronics would be fun, too.",r3bwps

Elagant Concept for a Simple Thought-to-Text Device! Feasable?,1,"The inspiration for this invention came from a friend of mine who mentioned the interesting and seemingly plausible fact that electrodes implanted in a part of the body such as a single finger could detect micro-vibrations when a subject merely concentrated on the intention to move that finger, even when no visible motion of the finger was acted out.

Now, imagine if we chose 26 body parts- say, 10 fingers plus some toes, elbows, knees, shoulders, ect. and attached 26 of these ""intention-triggered"" electrode sensors to them.

Then, we assign a letter of the alphabet to each sensor which instantly displays the triggered body-part/letter as text visible on a computer screen or on an Augmented Reality visor.

I think you can extrapolate where this is going....

The subject would need to be trained to use the device rapidly, of course, as if learning a new language.

But eventually, there would be fluency. Let's say the right pointer finger was assigned the letter ""A"" and the subject was asked to think the word ""Apple"". At first, they would think ""Okay, Apple starts with an ""A""... which body-part was ""A"" assigned to? ...Oh yeah, it was my right pointer finger."" Then they would not even scrunch up that finger as if typing a keyboard, but merely imagine doing so. Presumably, that electrode would detect the micro-vibrations in those nerves too small to even see a visible movement of the finger. The letter ""A"" appears on the screen or visor. Then they would continue with ""P"", ""P"", etc.

At first the process would be prohibitively slow, and the required body-part would need to be concentrated on intensly. But as the subject gained fluency, they would eventually reach a point where the body-part to letter process would become subconscious. Meaning, they wouldn't even need to consciously think ""Oh yeah, my right knee is ""Q"", so I must imagine moving my right knee."" They would merely think of the letter ""Q"", and due to their training and sheer muscle-memory, their right knee nerves would be subconsviously activated and ""Q"" would appear, for all practical purposes instantly and is if directly from their mind to the screen.

I imagine a very fluent subject would be able to think of a word and as they spelled it out in their minds the word would appear, possibly even faster than one could type it out manually, without the subject moving visibly at all, as if directly from ""Thought-to-Text"" (TM),

This device could have applications for disabled people like paraplegics or those in full-body casts, but I see it moreso intended as simply the natural evolution of the keyboard into something faster, more intuitive, more user-friendly and ""organic""/enjoyable to use.

I assume in a decade or two this form of typing would become the norm and physical keyboards would be phased out.

Also, as a bonus feature, the results assigned to each electrode would be user-variable like options assigned to buttons of a video-game controller. So, imagine instead of letters, each body-part could be assigned a color, or the note of a musical instrument. Thus, a visual artist could complete a color-by-number type painting with a ""Thought-to-Art"" Device (TM) or a musician with a ""Thought-to-Music"" Device.

Is there any logical reason this would not work with relatively simple and cheap technology we already have?

[Macro Idea] Minimal Visual Contamination,1,"Hi Everyone! My English is terrible, sorry for that.

So, the first part of the title consists on the creation of alternatives to known services. Youtube or Steam and even Reddit for example.

Maybe they could have an option to personalize the experience.

If I go to Youtube for example, I want to search for a specific video. Not be bombarded with tons of images and colors.

I think that it would help balance the coexistence between offline life and online activities. Making both more enjoyable and healthy for people that can't do that difference fromr their own, with all complications that it carries.

Time saving bank card. Skip the faux security. (Idea),1,"Fast cash, Blink bucks, Dosh pass, Fast Chit, Skip Chit

I could make 100 of these names for a card that pretty much skips all of the questions at checkout and just pays mostly for smaller daily purchases.

Obviously first off Chip, NFC, and strip don't put my personal info on the card the limit is low and the security is high.

Skip the signing at restaurants.(Have a preset percentage for tipping you set on an app which can be changed before it clears. Blacklist places it's stupid to tip at)

Skip All the pin pad questions

 Skip the Pin/signing at check out. (Security features below)
 Skip the asking if you want cash back. (Just turn it off for the card)
 Skip the are you sure.
 Skip the do you agree to this fee.(have that one at the local commissary twice in a row now)
 Skip the do you want a stupid warranty for your 3$ bathroom scale.(Looking at you hellmart)
 Skip the donate to a charity (pisses me off anyway I'm not donating to your tax write off why is this a thing that I don't see called out more)
 Skip the receipt completely it goes to your bank. (From there it is with each purchase. Some places offer to send it to your email but about 50% of the time it doesnt pull the email from your card and now all the sudden you have to type it in on that garbage pin pad screen)

Integrate all your rewards cards (Google pay already does this and is fairly fast at walgreens)

Security features to ensure the easy card is not abused since by nature it should be blazing fast to use.All of these should be adjustable and optional features

 Every so often you must tap the card on your phone and the NFT re-enables it or even refills if you have a limit you are nearing.
 Location tracking

1. The card only work if its been near your phone in the last day or so.
2. A push notification if your card is moving too far away from your phone also adjustable distance.
3. Location based security levels highest being that it must be near your phone to work or the limit is reduced significantly. (So you can go in and grab a drink while you left your phone in the car.)

Initially when I thought of this I thought it would be an everyday card with a low daily limit that was fast but with the security options I've laid out this is likely more secure than mose cards. That being said some features to expand past the original scope

Online purchases

 Virtual cards for everything online (All of this can be done with privacy.com)

1. Wanna cancel that subscription but you can't do it online. Screw em the virtual card doesn't exist anymore also if they somehow try to contact you they say you died of  Pentapox or something\^(Likely not legal) (Should be illegal to allow someone to sign up for a service online but not cancel with the same ease)
2. Same with utilities in small towns that go past greedy human eyes (my electric company compromised my card twice now. No idea if this is just a small town problem)
3. Kinda sketched out by the security of a site just use a one time virtual card

Aesthetic  
Totally pointless but I want it to be a nondescript flat color and have the Skip icon on it.Personalize it all you want just can't add pictures copyright nightmare.

Need help! Very niche but potentially very important idea for handicap accessibility in water sports.,4,"Idea, followed by back story:

A device that give supplemental oxygen to people likely to lose consciousness or bodily control while in open water.

For sports like surfing, water skiing, jet ski, certain swimming sports, and even rowing, any disorder that causes loss of bodily control can mean certain death, and this excludes a huge number of people from enjoying these sports.

The best answer I can come up with must be:

1) portable
2) reliable for oxygen delivery
3) implement some type of ""dead man"" switch
4) be mostly unobtrusive

Story about why I want to make this:

I have been madly, deeply falling in love with a wonderful woman, who is a very talented and dedicated surfer. She has won awards and recognition in the sport. A short time ago, she started developing epileptic seizures, and on rare occasion has grand mal seizures that cause temporary loss of consciousness. This was primarily controlled medically, until a short while ago, when she had a series of seizures while on the water. The final time she has such an episode, she nearly drowned. 

This woman is incredible. She is a journalist, a philanthropist, an environmentalist, and activist for social progress, a lover of animals and people, and just incredibly kind and beautiful in every way. She does more for others than most, and she never sweats it. Her biggest joy is spending time on the water, experiencing the ocean, and I think she deserves to have that. I need to figure out a way to make this happen.

My best idea so far is a very small supply of scuba air or oxygen, worn on a personal floatation device, with a breather mask, and a ""dead man"" thumb switch to activate flow of air in the event that a plunger is let loose. 

Any better ideas, or ways to implement or improve this idea would mean the world to a woman who deserves every joy the world can offer her, and to me, who doesn't deserve her in my life, and want to bridge that gap with my best efforts to be what she deserves. 

Any ideas? 💡",rkpxso

I just though about a Sound camera,1,"So it's exactly that, a camera but instead of electromagnetic waves, mechanical waves...

I can't think of any uses for that, but it would be really cool..

somekind of chamber made of sound isolating material. in the back, inside of the chamber many samall microphones that would act as the camera's sensors. and on the front of the chamber a small hole where any outside sound can enter freely: like a pupi.

conceptually it is the same as a ""dark  chamber"" or an actual camera, so Ideally it would produce images in a similar way

a problem that might emerge is the size and sensibility of the microphones. but still, even if we are not capable of producing decernable images, just a proof of concept os really cool! like the relative position of the sound source or something...

let me know what you guys think, does something like this already exists? (I would expect so given that this idea is very easy to come up with) and if there is not something like this, it leads me to think that the idea is just stupid...

Open Source medical research without intellectual property. Etica Protocol,2,"Since 2018 I've been working on the creation of a blockchain Protocol for Open Source Medical research without intellectual property aka the Etica Protocol. [https://www.eticaprotocol.org](https://www.eticaprotocol.org)

Victor Hugo :  ""Nothing is More Powerful than an Idea Whose Time has Come""

I think the time for Etica has come, so let me share a brief presentation of Etica with you.

Brief presentation:

Etica aims to promote open source medical research without intellectual property. It incentivizes publication of research oriented papers (by professionals or not) for each disease added to the network.

Etica protocol has its own currency Etica (ETI). The protocol has a fixed inflation of about 2.5% per year. Thanks to this inflation it funds the curation rewards (for voters) and editor rewards (for creators of proposals).

It operates based on periods of 7 days. For each period a curation\_reward as well as an editor\_reward will be issued by the Protocol (respecting the 2.5% yearly inflation rate). For each period all users can submit Proposals in order to get a part of the editor\_reward  of the period. Etica token holders can submit and vote on proposals  using a staking system (They have to lock Eticas for 28 days in exchange  for bosoms). Bosoms are a unit of measure inherent to the protocol that is used by the voting system. All proposals can be voted upon for 3 weeks. After the voting duration has been passed the Protocol rewards or penalises participants based on the outcome of the votes.

The protocol is designed in such a way that only about 72% of proposals will be accepted. Thus due to open source competition the creators of proposals will have to improve the quality of their papers to get a proposals accepted by the network as things progress

The  creator of a proposal that was accepted by the network will be rewarded  with a part of the period's editor\_reward that will be proportional to  the amount of Eticas that was used by token holders to vote on the  proposal. If the proposal is rejected, depending on the level of the  rejection the creator of the proposal will have it's stack duration  increased (for instance 65 days) or even lose funds (to submit you have  to put a collateral of 10 ETI that you can lose if proposal is heavily  rejected by the network).

The  voters that vote on the wining side (can be either accepted or  rejected) will get a part of the curation\_reward proportional to the  amount of Eticas they have used to vote on the proposal. If they vote on  the losing side, their stack will be increased (for instance 84 days  longer) in proportion to the level of rejection.

Full details in the whitepaper.

The whitepaper:

The  Etica whitepaper (9 pages) describes how the protocol will operate in  details. (As Published and sent to the original Satoshi Nakamoto mailing  list in September 2019)

[https://eticaprotocol.org/viewwhitepaper](https://eticaprotocol.org/viewwhitepaper)

[The smart contract:](https://github.com/etica)

The Etica smart contract is on [github/etica](https://github.com/etica). It is a complexe smart contract that successfully implements everything described in the whitepaper  in the form of an Ethereum smart contract. If you are a developper or  you know ethereum developpers tell them to review this smart contract. I  have full confidence they will assess the quality of the code.

Etica is all about open source and creating a community based project with nobody having specific privileges.  Even if I started to work on Etica alone,  I understand the potential  of this project, it is much bigger than me and to succeed it needs to be completely decentralised from day 1.

This is why I want to underline these facts:

1. I plan to launch Etica in coming months from scratch as soon as there will be a community
2. There will be no premine
3. Anybody joining Etica will have same rights, aka I won't have any privilege nor anybody else
4. It is completely open source
5. It is a neutral protocol
6. There is no backdoor Key or Key with specific rights
7. The smart contract will be launched on its Blockchain (a Fork of Ethereum Proof of work)
8. The initial supply will be distributed trough mining
9. Mining will stop forever once we reach 21 Million Eticas (should take several years)
10. Then only the yearly inflation of 2.5% will generate new Eticas.

I don't want my phone to be in the bedroom when I sleep and I'm also not looking to have a smart speaker beside my bed because a) I don't really like the look of them and b) they feel way too connected which is what I'm trying to minimize when sleeping.

Just as important as the alarm feature, I'd also like the clock to be able to play an audiobook when I'm falling asleep. Currently, I just use my phone on the pillow which feels horrible and means I have to look at a screen to turn it off.

Does such a device exist because I haven't been able to find one?   
Do many people listen to some form of audio like this while falling asleep?

For reference - it's a similar sort of 'unplugged' concept like the OneClock but allows bedtime audio listening and uses audiobooks/podcasts/radio to wake you up.",r2l4mp

An App That Mimics Snapchat Memories,5,"I hate social media, I think its a huge waste of time. I have successfully been able to delete every social media I have asides from Reddit (bc reddit is just different lol) and Snapchat. The reason I have snapchat still is because I have had snapchat for years, and I have so many snapchat memories on there that mean a lot to me. I want to delete the app very much so but dont want to lose those memories. If there was an app that mimicked the way snapchat memories works, that would be amazing.

I would just download all of them onto my phone, but asides from the fact that it takes too much space, I love the aspect of the dates in which the memories occurred. For example, there are always ""3 years ago, today"" memories that come up which would be a feature completely taken away if I were to download them.

Wacky Electrical question,8,"Got a bit of an odd ask.

I'm writing a book. to skip to the relevant part, i'm trying to write about a hypothetical extreme cold weather suit that is hooked up with a jerry-rigged heating system. Pretty much made from scrap (Think Fallout) Basically the premise so far is I have a respirator system (think SCUBA) linked up to a powered heater that heats intake air for respiration and does not permit cold air into the system. It achieves this through a series of heating elements wired to a bunch of laptop batteries. During the day, solar panels charge the batteries. The suit (in writing) can last 3 hours on a full charge. Its supposed to be cycled on/off to recharge while letting the suits insulation hold the heat in the meantime.

I am not an electrician. I know this is cracked out. 

A) What are the issues and how do I plug them?

B) what would be another way to heat air rapidy that could fit in a large backpack?

C) What are some details i could add for extra realism?",qza0ka

Looking for new application fields,0," 

Dear community!

I am looking for an application field for a new foil. Imagine you had a foil that can do the following: The whole foil can conduct electricity and seperatly transfer information. You could for example integrate LEDs and control them individually, so you can use it for lighning or even make a display out of it. Another possibility would be to use it as an alarm system, due to many sensors that need electricity as well as information. In addition, there would be a possibility of power plugs, that could be placed anywhere on the foil. Furthermore, the foil could be adapted to individual needs, it is flexible and could be cut in any form and size. The individual elements could be applied as desired. You could also use it outside, due to the fact that it is very robust.

Do you have ideas or suggestions, where the foil could find use? Have you ever been in a situation where this foil would have helped you?",qxi2kd

Military and Luxury Planes that turn into Different Sized Hangers.,1,"\Hangar 😭

The fuselage separates and the long halves spread apart along a track underneath the wing becoming the wall of the hangar. This can even be done rudimentarily with a fuselage that fits together with large jigsaw puzzle-like teeth tightly bound together forming a seam running along its length at the bottom and a locking rod stuck through the seam of teeth that connects the fuselage.

The rudimentary idea for this is very practical for a minimalistic design. The halves of the fuselage open and run along the track towards the tip of the wings forming a low hangar, which has a prehistoric rock home aesthetic.

This idea has so many applications and tweaks:

Instead of the fuselage separating, legs can simply extend from the tips of the wings and create more of a tent, without walls.

Barn-sized and Hangar-sized airplanes might require smaller fuselages, but that's not problematic:

Implementing joints into the wings of these crafts would allow the airplanes enhanced turning capabilities by tilting their wings. Seeing a large bird aircraft tilt its wings would look intense especially with loose and fast hinge release mechanism, just like how a loose hinge flops around. This flapping and tilting causes the craft to look futuristic and intimidating! Seeing one of these in the sky would be like something you'd see in a movie, and with freaky lights too, it could be really intimidating!

Having airplanes that serve multiple functions like gunship designs or water craft, these birds have a lot of human charm to them I'd love to see come alive in both military and luxury use.

"Bicycle Parking Kiosk (Reorganized, Pitch-Like)",3,"E-bikes are something that almost everyone kinda wants to use.  But what is the biggest thing keeping people from adopting them?

#THEFT

(Well, insanely homicidal motor vehicle drivers are a close second.)

You know in the USA, and many other countries, bicycle theft is a leading pastime of criminals.  Even though an e-bike can qualify as GRAND THEFT (just as bad as stealing a car) in most states, police will practically never bother with such a crime, making it 'practically legal' to steal and vandalize them.  Heck, many times a few parts are stripped, and the whole thing is thrown into a dumpster.  Or may as well be, due to the destructive methods used to extract 'valuable' parts.

There is ebike insurance, but how often can you collect on insurance, then wait up to months for your replacement bike to be delivered, just to have it stolen again?  So your ebike gets stored away somewhere, unused, where it can't be stolen... but why do you even have it now?

Your options are empty iron loops for you to chain your bike to, or nothing at all but what you can improvise to chain your bike to.  Nobody pays attention to bike thieves at all, even as they use huge bolt cutters and angle grinders in public.

Every second you're away from your chained bike is spent worrying about whether it's being stolen right now.

So, how about a bicycle security kiosk?  Give it a roof to somewhat protect the bikes from the weather, and gives the kiosk secure places to mount things, and with remotely monitored (over the internet) video.  Each bicycle spot has its own built-in electronic lock, with an extra-long cable to secure both wheels and frame, with video instructions on-site for how to do it.  Available in multiple sizes, from 4 to 64 parking spots.  Or just add more kiosks as you go.

Plus where these appear, there are one or more mobile vans that show up to investigate suspicious happenings at these kiosks, do 24 hour maintenance, and on-call bicycle service for minor repairs and transportation to qualified bike shops.  If something goes wrong at a kiosk, summon help.  Those vans exist for a reason.  Our cities are full of little vermin who destroy everything.

A kiosk parking slot can be locked and unlocked with the phone or credit card that you used to lock the bike with.  It will turn on an AC outlet over the slot you parked your ebike at, to charge it while you're away.  Buy a parking slot per use, or from a monthly subscription.  With optional additional levels of insurance on your bike, on top of ""we'll make it work again"" insurance.  Show your bike to the camera before you lock it.  Show your bike to the camera after you unlock it.  Or summon the service van for assistance if damage has occurred.

Every grocery store, strip mall, downtown area, mall, office space, public buildings, beach, park, etc. might have this kiosk, offering per-use security and affordable monthly subscriptions for peace of mind.  The foot traffic from the premium security might even make the regular public bike racks more viable as a place to leave your bicycle for a while.  

With the mobile app, you could get notified of disturbances to your bike in the kiosk, with pictures, AND at the same time the service van will be notified to check up, and possibly the police.  Within a relatively short time, these kiosks will get a reputation of being well guarded, with prompt security/police response.  Since imagery of the kiosks is streamed to people monitoring at home, as their jobs.  It goes 'beep', take a look.  Back to your normal internet addictions.  Something happened?  Dispatch alert to the internal forum about something happening, let the vans know.  Let the police know if it's obviously a crime.  HD video constantly recorded in a loop (similar to dash cams), so time before and after a disturbance is captured.

Better than finding your broken lock on the ground where your cargo bike used to be, with half a cart full of groceries.  

Each kiosk will have a small video screen.  For instructions, showing the QR code for the app, local ads, community maps, etc. and confirming/locking/unlocking slots.  AC power outlets over each spot.  A bicycle hoop and lock assembly, to secure the bicycle.  Cameras pointed in several directions to give an overview of the bikes and area around the bikes.  LED lighting to keep everything well lit.  It may flash or give warnings when it's alerting and recording.  Even if the screen gets broken, people with the app or cards will still be able to interact with the system to unlock their own bikes.

Probably the most key thing in the system are the service vans.  Keep the kiosks shiny, clean and functional.  Above all the appearance of active patrol.  One piece of graffiti on a wall attracts a thousand more.  Vandalism has to be cleaned up quick.  Police need to be referred to violations.  People who try to disturb users' bikes MUST be prosecuted.  Security, minor bike repairs and parts, kiosk troubleshooting and repair.

On the back-end, a VPN for the kiosks to live in, and some internet infrastructure for the people who monitor the video to report activity, and get the messages to the vans.

Lots of ways to sell these to a city council or chamber of commerce or people with some extra space in their parking lots.  They don't need tons of infrastructure.  Their own built-in internect connectivity and power.  Just need a little space, hardly more space than any other bicycle parking.  Provide a lit-up place for bicycles at night.  People on bikes are a bit more likely to make other stops on their trips.  Especially when considering the cost of operating an ebike versus a car, or maneuvering it into strange, new places.  The kiosks giving the public a sense of security to leisurely hang around restaurants and shops and theaters without worrying about their ride.",qnwam8
Bicycle Parking Kiosk,4,"An open stall similar to a bus stop.  Roofed with bicycle rack and  very secure integrated bike locks and cables that are opened electronically with your credit card or any RFID card with a 'chip' in it, that matches what you locked it with.  Plenty of illustrated instructions, a clear map of where you are.  Maybe it's just a video screen for this, so yeah, ads.  Battery backup so if power is interrupted, you can still get your bike, at least.

When you lock the bike, it takes your picture.  When you unlock the bike (electronically), it takes your picture.  Motion sensors detect anyone futzing with the bikes and live-stream it to the nearest police (or city, or management) dispatch to record and display.  24 hour cameras from multiple angles and well lit place to put your bike or e-bike.  Maybe even turn on an outlet with your credit card, to charge your e-bike.

Maybe if you lock with your cell phone (and provided app), it will notify you and email pictures of your bike if anyone disturbs it on the rack.  Also integrate with a map app, so you can find where you parked it again, especially in some unfamiliar downtown.

Possibly a part of a bike rental service, which rented out e-bikes and provided extra stalls for other bikes.  Again, rent it with the app, go through the check out inspection procedure.  Keep track of rejected bikes so someone can come out and fix/replace it.  Return the bike at the stall with the check in inspection procedure, including plugging it back in and posing with the bike (both sides) to show its condition.",qnoeaq

Non-Variable Scale-able green/clean energy invention,4,"Hello, I need some help/advice

Telepathy device,2,"We have technology already that can see what someone is thinking. That can interpret what someone is saying. The technology we have must be right on the head because our brainwaves are weak.

What if you put a small device on the head, that interprets what the brain is saying, that then transmits those waves in the form of radio waves, that transmits them to someone's receiver on someone's else's head that then uses another process to transmit the image or words into someone's mind? 

If we have the technology that can decode what the brain is saying, we should be able to have technology to send information back into the brain. 

You could also take a step back, and just use the device to transmit sound waves for people to hear, or radio/wifi waves to be picked up on devices like phones for people that can't talk or move. Or you could transmit short short wifi waves for close communication or other radio waves to talk to people farther away to which a device, perhaps utilizing an app, will interpret those signals. I could see someone who cannot talk or move to be able to talk to their family easily in the house, or be able to talk to their family a long way away just thinking about it.

You could also just do a slight surgery that connects the device to the brain as well if it was needed. Additionally, you would be able to control some electronic devices, and hear what's around you in radio waves by tuning your telepathy device.",rs64d7

Help with best path forward,1,"Hi everyone, I'm seeking some advice about how to move forward.

I have an idea in the works. I've been doing everything I can to bring it to life with absolutely no experience. Unfortunately, I've hit a roadblock in the prototype phase. One piece of my design didn't work and I have a few redesigns I'd like to try. Here's my problem: I can't get the new pieces to work out in the 3D software, and I believe it is because I am so inexperienced and am still lacking ability. I'm using free Tinkercad. 

Would you recommend spending more time on learning 3D design and/or spending on better software or hiring someone to help me with this piece? What do I need to do in regards to keeping all rights if I hire someone? 

Any advice is very much appreciated!",rr9he4
Slurpee vape,0,"It’s a vape mod that’s shaped like a slurpie, or perhaps a milkshake, heck anything that you can slurp, and have the mod go with it and have it like a straw.  Then when they hit it, it makes that kind of air slurp sound.  It was have a nice visual-audio effect, and I think it would look cool. It would be dope.  Could I do a Kickstarter? Only have concept, but would need to find people to help design and produce it.",rqe9s3
question about utility of the Intermediate Axis Theorum,1," 

Hello, I started work on a design for a gyroscope style device with an aim at generating power from the gearing up of energy through the three axis.

I built a device with three rings of smaller, middle, and larger size with bearings and carefully balanced to freely rotate.  
The rings were energized with magnets and coils so that an electric pulse would make it spin

I began by studying the interactions of the rings - I could spin the largest one and it would get the smallest one going, with interesting side effects. The momentum would periodically get stopped by the middle ring sort of hiccupping. I had discovered (and later researched) the Intermediate Axis Theorum, and believe that is what was happening to effectively stop the rotation of the rings.

I find this behavior of spinning objects very interesting, and it also stands in the way of my energy generator gear thingamabob. So I started to think of ways to USE THE INTERMEDIATE AXIS THEORUM, something I haven't seen anyone do.

Has anyone created an application for the IAT?  
Does anyone with an advanced knowledge of physics want to wade into this?  
Can the force that occurs to flip the intermediate axis be harnessed?  
Would a perfectly timed reversal of poles negate the middle ring's desire to flip (allowing it to accelerate in the one direction physically by alternating direction of current internally)?

Point me in the right direction?

Thanks",rqapir

How do you find a developer/dev company to help make a prototype?,1,"Hey all, 

How does someone with an invention idea go about developing a working prototype without themselves being a tech person? Say the idea were a wearable device that interacts with your computer via bluetooth--how would you go about finding someone to work with on actually getting that idea out of the imagination/sketch phase, and into real engineering and ultimately working form?

Are there companies that are well known for that space that are also trustworthy? What types of protection does one need in order to protect the idea from being stolen? Do such companies usually take up front fees or ask for a % of rights? 

Pretty new to all this and much of the research I am finding online is geared towards getting prototypes made for objects--ie things that can be 3d printed and don't also need to function electronically--or for apps, which are a different thing entirely.

Any good resources as well that people in here rely on? Whether it be books, sites, podcasts, etc?

How do people nowadays get funding for inventions?,2,"Ever since I can remember i’ve been dreaming big and the only thing on my mind is making a brighter future for the world. I recently got my hands on a biography of Nikola Tesla and I learned he actually got his funding from J.P. Morgan. I’m not totally against crowdfunding but with all the stories of amazing inventions being stolen, that’s just about a last resort. Besides that what other options are available now? 

I’ve noticed that I start the building of my prototypes but quickly run out of funding out of my own pockets. It’s been kind of the limiting factor to bringing my dreams into reality. I believe that if I had more at my disposal, I could keep the ball rolling and crank out tons of prototypes.",rzp15y

Electric car removable batteries?,6,"Had a conversation discussing the best cars and electric over fossil fuels but the issues with electric cars being the battery life and it got me thinking
Couldn’t all electric cars have a uniform design for the battery pack so that it could be removable and that way you had the option of either carrying spare batteries so that you could pull over and swap them out so it goes back to 100% then just charge them back up at home or petrol stations could have a 3 tier system in which you buy one of there battery packs and when you then finally run low you just disconnect and swap it for one they have already charged at a discounted cost depending the tier you buy 
It just reminds me of LPG gas and how you take the empty cans to be filled or swapped for a full one. 
Does anyone think this could be implemented? Or help?",rzbfm9

The Virtual Reef of Intellectual Property,1,"Cross-pollination has been mentioned in many studies as the way individuals from different backgrounds come together to share inspirations, motivation and support. That is what usually happens in metropolitan areas. Cities like New York, San Francisco, and Tokyo attract creative minds from across the world. They are hubs of innovation that keep pushing the boundaries of what’s possible and that is what [Arkbase](http://arkbase.co/) is all about on the third layer of the internet, the [Web3](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/what-is-web3-new-version-of-the-internet-everyone-is-talking-about-130641883.html?guccounter=1&guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly9kdWNrZHVja2dvLmNvbS8&guce_referrer_sig=AQAAAHYfWFkwLfTyr6pZy88YAS7ftiZg-8qvsQjQKp3gSVAjFf-ArkNnUrhJWcKq3u7Wbcv5082NyilqxdS62AxlXtgRoNsUYHG6kuTriBSERahVwPgv3-p3dgXZyq16gmMXZocsM6uladmYRTUH9k4XKUBATKJKvyrfBFktqQ3sQsFV).

Arkbase can be viewed as a virtual reef where inventors, developers, and investors come together to nurture invention ideas that will change the way things are done. We help abstract ideas get exposure in a crypto-safe environment. What that means is all ideas that are shared on our platform are secured through a Public Ledger Technology (PLT) which saves every transaction in multiple locations and gives a public receipt back in seconds. This allows inventors to bring their supporters in this safe place to discuss the development of their ideas. Once a brainstorming session is concluded, a vote can be taken in a similar decentralized way.

Though voting can usually be considered a complicated process, services like [snapshot.org](https://snapshot.org/) make it easy and transparent. As mentioned in our [previous blog](https://www.arkbase.co/post/token-economics-serving-inventions) about token economics, early investors, along with inventors’ families and friends, are the actual decision-makers through their position of the invention coin. They get to decide where the funds get allocated and what direction should the developing team go. Now the developers, or contributors as we like to call them, are a bit different, they have two ways to join the community and a lesser commitment option. They can either buy tokens in projects they believe in or work their way in.

Developers’ compensation through tokens solves the inventor’s main current problem, being prey to bottom feeders. Getting paid through tokens means that it is in the interest of the developers to do a good job and stick around as long as possible. A CAD designer, for example, can choose to work for an invention and get paid in a token that is worth 0.2 dollars and then stick around and participate in the cross-pollination and voting processes that can bring the value of such a token up to 0.5 or 1 dollar. This process is unique to Arkbase and promises all with a stake in the invention of a democratized environment where every voice is heard and every token held is weighed.

Bringing inventors together with early investors and contributors on one public secure authenticated table could be achieved only after the adaptation of crypto technologies, PLT to be exact and Arkbase is dedicated fully to solving the inventor’s problem. With us, you don’t have to do it alone, we’ll be with you the whole nine yards. We’ll help you launch your coin, raise funds and get developers to work with you using your own token, we only succeed after you do. As [growth engineering](https://www.growthengineering.co.uk/) defines cross-pollination “It's about combining the intellectual capital of individuals with different ways of thinking to reach innovative solutions.” and Arkbase is going to be the virtual reef to do so.",ryb45n
Hair bruch New generation,1,"please excuse my english if it is not perfect.  it would be a product that would target female customers much better.
 I explain;  Your hair, unfortunately, has a terrible natural tendency to absorb the odors around you and the bacteria in it.  Whether it's while smoking or hanging out with smokers, coming out of a workout, staying in a room that smells too much, or even being out on the street for too long.  You feel the need to remove those odors and unwanted effects that are damaging your hair.  However, you may not have the time or the inclination to start your treatment and wait for it to work.
 This is why we created an innovative solution to enable consumers of cosmetic products to use their hair care more effectively.  We are therefore looking to create a new generation hairbrush, which will have the direct capacity to apply your care.  This brush can receive what are called ""doses"", this variety of doses will be composed of different types of products: exotic perfumes, essential oils, moisturizing lotions ... the consumer can choose the doses of his choice, which correspond to his  current needs, and can insert them inside the brush (where a compartment will be created beforehand).  This is how, while brushing their hair, the recipient can spray the contents of the dose that they have inserted onto their scalp.  To do this, all he has to do is press a button on the handle of this brush and the pressure system will do the rest of the work.
 This brush will offer the ability, at the same time, to perfume your hair with a sweet scent of vanilla while being at work or at school, but it will also allow you to apply specific care much more in depth.
 Transportable, discreet and easy to use, consumers can take care of themselves at any time.",rxs436

Smart-Fridge,3,"A smart fridge could have a barcode scanner to allow you to quickly and conveniently scan every item on the way in or out so your fridge knows almost everything that's in it. For other produce it might have a couple of weight plates and the standard grocery checkout selection menu so you can manually enter anything else that might not be contained within supermarket databases or have a barcode.

This allows for several desires and benefits including:

 Near Real time and accurate tracking of your calories, fats vs protein vs carbs, nutrient profiles and more.
 Automatic re-ordering of certain foods according to your profile options- you might want to select based on calorie count for the week or month, based on a certain diet etc.
 Phone alerts or emails for when something is going bad or running low.
 Adjustable diet plans whenever you want.

This might capture large parts of diet and weight-loss markets and I suspect might also capture parts of the market for products like Huel/Soylent where people want an all-round nutrient profile but without the complications of sorting through all the different groceries available.

Some limitations include:

 Only as accurate as your willingness to scan items.
 Less useful for families and more than 1-2 people.
 Will somewhat rely on supermarket API/ordering or sites like Amazon.",rxkfgo
An automatic back-scratcher,7,"I love back massagers, especially the massaging chairs and portable shiatsu massage machines.

A Maintenance-Free Device to Keep Air Lines Clean,3,"A friend of mine developed a device that keeps air lines free of build up, eliminating the need to clean them. I presented to upper management at Starbucks roughly two years ago, as they have Nitro coffee in most all of their stores, however Covid soon hit, halting all communication. Here's an excerpt from my original email...

""It takes a Partner roughly 45 minutes a week to properly clean the Nitro lines (assuming it's getting done at all). If that Partner is making $12.00/hour, that's $9.00/week, and $468.00/year per store. With over 30,000 stores, that's over $14,000,000.00 a year Starbucks spends on a service with very little return. 14 million dollars a year. That doesn't even include the cost it takes to bring out a maintenance company to service the machines, with the issue more often than not being due to dirty lines.""

This product is patent pending and I have a prototype ready to go, proving that it works, all without the need of electricity. 

This doesn't only apply to Starbucks, as is works with all air lines, including Nitro coffee, beer, soda, etc. 

If anyone has any use for it, please don't hesitate to reach out.",rwbx77
