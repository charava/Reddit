Quick question,1,"Does anyone happen to know where I could make an invention come true? I have an idea that could change the way some of us work with electronics for our entire lives. In order to do so, I need to find someone who is well versed in the legality of copywriting, patenting, and also of course someone who has worked with an inventor before. I would like to eventually take my idea to big companies and see how they would like to work with it or maybe tweak it a bit. If anyone has any helpful knowledge or recommendations don't hesitate to comment!",f7d617
Rubber Buddyz,5,so everybody knows that when you wear a necklace the clasp always seems to slip down in front of their neck which seriously alters the effect of necklace. My idea is to have small clip-on rubber cylinders to put at the back of the chain so that way it will stay in place on your neck. What do you think?,eiohlk
An App to Organize an Event with complete Strangers,5,"Minimal Scope of the MVP

An App that lets user organize or start an event that anyone (a complete stranger) can join. There would be different types of event that can be organized like travel, party, dinner, art exhibit, youtube collab, sports/game, mass gathering, ""for-a-cause"" events and etc. Each type of event will have its own features like for example in a Travel event, an organizer can setup the itineraries, the travel rules, number of participants, contributions/memberships and etc. User can be an ""Organizer"" or a ""Goer"" and their account will have a profile on each type in which they can have their own timeline to post the events they organized or they participated. In each event (as a whole) the goers can rate it like ""it was a flop"", ""I somehow enjoyed it"", ""best experience or it's a blast"" something like that and they can also leave a review in it. Also, the Goers can give ratings and feedback/review to the Organizer on how he/she organized the event as a whole. In addition, depending on an event type (Travel for example) Goers can also give ratings and feedbacks to their fellow Goers. Meaning, they can leave their stories/experiences with their co-Goers as to what kind of event buddy he/she is.

The Catch

Now here's the catch, the Goers will not be revealed upon joining. Meaning, they are completely anonymous until they will see each other in the event proper (let me know if this is cool or a dumb feature). This is to avoid different discriminations. As long as the Goer agrees to the rules the organizer has specified and can afford the contributions or expenses of the event, then whatever her/his physical, spiritual or any kind or personal attributes will not be a hindrance from joining an event. Only the Backoffice (admin) will have the Goers and Organizers identity revealed since we plan to avoid fake events and participants. Before a user can create or join an event, the user must be identity verified first in the backoffice (personal data will be private of course).

Scalability and Marketability

In my mind I know it would be scalable and marketable since this app plans also to cater reservation systems that can be proposed to establishment owners to include their businesses in the app. Meaning, they will only register their businesses and the will have a panel to handle the reservations. We can also put an ""event commissions"" on events created for a profit. We will also secure the participant's contribution by escrowing it. Meaning, we can only release the contributed amount only if the event is already done. In this feature, an organizer must ensure to cater own event expenses first and will not depend on the contributions. But of course the organizer can view the total event contributions in real-time (if needed). For now, these are the only things that's popping in my head. But I know this can be a huge thing if properly realized.

Development

I am a Sr. Developer myself. I have 7 years experience in developing SaaS, Websites and Mobile Apps for different projects. I will create the wireframes of the MVP to start the project.  I only have this idea in my mind and anyone might be interested to collab (in anyway to be a partner), we can further discuss this idea. Just let me know.

Let me know what you think about this App Idea if it's a blast or a flop. Thanks!",ra21of

"Launching a new product, honest feedback request.",14,"
In a nutshell- Went to take out the trash mid summer and was disgusted by the smell of my garbage bin.

Came up with the idea for an automatic outdoor garbage bin deodorizer.

2 yrs later after market research, testing, r&d, prototyping, tooling etc we finally have a market ready product and just launched our e-commerce.

Honest feedback appreciated!

I'm at a crossroads in my life.,3,"As the title describes, I have found myself at a very clear fork in the road as life choices go. If I'm being real, I already know what I should do. That's not what this is about. I'd like very much to just lay out my situation, and get some feedback from the internet at large.  So the novel begins. My boyfriend and I (me:bisexual man, him: gay man) have been together for very nearly 4 years. The beginning of our relationship came at the heels of a devastating tragedy in the form of the loss of a my dearest and longest friend as well as the heartbreak of my very first open guy-and-guy relationship ending in me being ghosted by a long time friend of myself and my family. ""N"" (my current boyfriend and basically the subject of this post) came into my life through tinder, and we fell madly for each other very quickly. But if I'm being honest it was never much of a physical attraction, and in fact I soon found myself being the bottom (yeah we goin there) in my first real gay relationship, even after I fully knew for myself that I was a top and did not enjoy bottoming in any way. Add to all this that my boyfriend was immediately both very possessive, needy and demanding, as well as having an SEVERE anger management issue. For the first 2 or so years he would regularly explode on me, often threatening or actually committing some form of violence on me (pushing, kicking, etc.). Eventually I found my backbone,  kicked back, and things got better. I told him I am not and will never be a bottom, and with that and many other concessions, we eventually found ourselves in a relatively happy, healthy relationship. Until time happened. As we went along, I began to become less and less interested in my partner sexually, and more and more irritated with the way he treated me. Cut to us 3.5 years in, we have managed to stay together but not without at least 3 official break ups in the intervening time. At this point,I love my partner very much, and I want him to be in my life, but I know all too well that I can't spend forever with him, and since he moved his best friend in with us a couple months ago I know for a fact that we've both felt that things are not right and we may be headed in different directions. But then we ignore that ""fight"" and a month later here we are, he spends every moment not at work hangin with his friend in the living room while I hang in our room. I'm just not that social due to my anxiety disorder and I know he'd say I should just hang out there with him but I don't think its crazy for me to say ""hey, I'd rather be in my comfortable lil space and have you hang with me every once in a while there than go sit in the living room awkwardly while you guys chat it up and giggle about inside jokes."" His BF isn't my BF, and I feel like I'm losing a battle that I don't even want to fight. Any and all feedback is appreciated.",fyy9yh

Collective Bargaining For Prescription Medications / Improve Med Prices,3,"Medication prices are increasing to levels that are not sustainable.  In an ideal world, people come together and negotiate the best prices.  Insurances should be that vehicle and should negotiate better prices for its customers.

But with the current legislation and the allowance of rebates, coupon cards, pharmacy benefit managers, and hidden prices from the end customers, patients are actually seeing higher prices with their insurance copays than what they would pay for if they just paid cash.  Many times people don't know this either (lack of price transparency).  Now this isn't always the case and is dependent on one's insurance plan but this is becoming more of an issue as more people are being pushed into high deductible insurance plans.

My app idea would be for individuals to collectively group together and to purchase mail order prescription medications.

 Groups of patients would join together by prescription medication with individual unit requests (ex: 4 novolog insulin pens)
 Prescriptions would be verified by their physician.
 Pharmacies and/or manufacturers (only licensed and registered medication distributers allowed) would bid on servicing the group's orders - like a tendering for the orders.
 A ""reverse auction"" at regular intervals (ex: every 2 weeks or once a month, depending on demand) would occur where the pharmacy with the lowest bidding price wins servicing the orders. The orders would be mailed to the customers and patients can fill their prescriptions.

Initial Pros/Cons:

 Patients may have to wait longer for their orders to be processed but this would group customers together to collectively bargain for the best prices. If they need the medications sooner, a local pharmacy in today's traditional model can service them better.
 This makes sense for patients who need scheduled medications for long periods of time. A medication that is of short duration or an urgent need would be better serviced at an individual's local pharmacy
 This would allow individuals to get the cheapest cash prices and even be able to go back to their insurance and submit a claim for coverage, although coverage would ultimately be determined by their insurance and may be denied. In that case, the patient is not using their insurance (or contributing to their deductible) like GoodRx's model.
 This would expose hidden prices of medications and increase transparency to customers and the marketplace.

Music review/discussion app,2,"So there are movie review apps, youtube has comment sections, and influencers have plenty of feedback from fans on socials. Why not one for music specifically? I know what you are thinking, musicians and artists have social media and can have comments their - but the artist/management can simply delete anything you comment on their posts/tweets. If you go on fandango you can read reviews of films, but they are managed by fandango who acts as a third party, only removing unnecessary hate and spam reviews. 

There is no way for artists to read about what their fans think directly. They just look at stats such as listen time and downloads but you have to stream a song to know if you like it or not, invalidation most stats. It's the repeated listens and sharing with friends that make an artists successful. 

This kind of platform would be a direct way for fans to review new songs and suggestions. Of course you could like or dislike comments in the same fashion as reddit. This would allow an artist to see exactly what people think and have the future potential to stream music like Spotify, but also have a comment section. And at the end of the day it doesn't matter if artists like the platform. It's about if fans like the ability to discuss with other fans the new album or song that came out. 

Music has a magical effect on us, simple sounds make us happy, sad, excited, focused, etc. And hearing that one song that makes you escape from reality deserves to be discussed.",rhkzfx

HDMI Content,6,"I had this idea because there are too many streaming services cluttered with shows and movies.

How hard would it be to license all John Wayne movies or all seasons of Friends and upload them onto a HMDI device similar to a firestick. This would essentially be a transitional away from box sets/dvds. The device could also offer a subscription for updated trivia/art from the Reddit page. It could also have the capability of downloading new seasons or movies provided a payment. That way if your obsessed with Lord of the Rings you could have all the content in a single transferable location. Would have a phone app as a remote as well. Let me know general feedback.

Bring your own characters,2,"So, I seen a lot of people wanting their original characters to be real, so I thought of an idea for that.


So you remember that one Cosmo toy, right? 

A little cute robot that learned from you.

so what if there was a think where you could bring your own creations to life.

Here are the steps to bringing your little person to life.




Step 1. You draw a picture of how you want your character to look.

Step 2. They make it into a plush and give it a skeleton.

Step 3. They give you something to help you keep up with it, it's an App.

You can check on their health, smarts and who they can recognize.





Step 4. You can give it a personality from 3 personality types.


Normal: they like to learn from you, overall nice, recognizes faces easily.

Stubborn: their dialogue is kind of mean, but alike to normal.

Shy: can't remember names that well, alike to normal.





Step 5. you give it a heart (it's what makes it function.) If you remove it, it stops functioning.

Final Step. and then you can talk to it, push it over, teach it like your child, play with it, make it cry.


Anyways that's my idea.",rkalcc

A Portable handheld gaming PC,1,"So my idea is to get a portable handheld pc, but with an external gpu. Which in theory I believe is possible. (I'm just not sure how much battery power the thing would need to be able to run for a solid amount of time.)  
But basically with an upboard squared, and a mini pcie to pci adapter, I can run a gpu on a tiny computer. And let's say I have a mini gtx1050 ti. Since both have its own cooling system, heat shouldn't be a problem. Only problem I'm stuck on is the size. I'm going to probably spend my summer messing with this idea to see if it can be possible. 

The outcome would be a device similar to a DS. And it would be far, FAR, cheapter than buying a GPD win or a smach z. (At most 250$?) And of course I can get a weaker gpu too! Since the screen size is tiny, no one is going to notice if the graphics are not the greatest. Of course the CPU is something to laugh at, but hey this is mostly intended for gaming anyway! If I could do it the way I want, I would take an i3 raizen or something and slap on a cpu cooler lol.  


Current problems I can think of:

Size, (How big is the gtx 1050)

Discounting the quality of the game as I haven’t hashed out the details, is this idea sound? In theory the coins will rise in value as the demand for the game rises, causing a frenzy affect as more and more users adopt. Would you play the game if it meant you could earn real crypto coins?",r3qm7x
Ideas to reality ( Honest feedback),4,"So I came to realize having an idea be it an app idea, product idea, or whatever, people always have ideas but to implement it and stay consistent is where the real hustle begins. When you have a team to work with who accepts your idea and works towards the idea it becomes a success. Individuals with great ideas such as in this sub just ignore it after they know that it's just one of the thoughts that pass by in their daily thoughts. Not everyone with a great idea becomes a success and also not everyone with great implementing skills becomes successful. It is when both combine in the right proportion it leads to success

So here's where I am thinking about not letting ideas go to waste. I was thinking of an app where you can list your ideas and people can explore ideas and if they like it can be a part of it by sending a request and once the request is accepted, you can contact the idea creator and discuss and if you feel connected, you can go ahead with the idea to make it to reality.

Mechadildo and Mecha Fleshlight,3,"Add that extra dimension to your porn!

An internet connected device (male or female) that reproduces live or pre-programmed movements, scaled properly to the genitalia involved.  Probably should be bluetooth and powered by internal batteries, with wireless charging.  It's something that should be built safe for full immersion and cleaning.

For videos, add a 'stroke' track, giving x/y/z/θ/φ positions for the device to conform to, over time, synchronized with the video.

For live interaction, repeats/mirrors actions on both sides.  So a live sex act can be more fully enjoyed on both sides.  Make prostitution safe and private for both sides.

Naturally the device driver should check for 'safe limits' and user preferences for 'how safe' before allowing mechanical motion that is too extreme.  Can't have it skewering or ripping 'parts' off the person who is using the device due to malicious (or corrupted) input data.

From there, other options, such as optional constant vibration or whatever can be added on top.  Plus open (anonymous) forums for feedback and complaints.

Maybe deluxe 'doll' versions of various sizes with more dimensions of movement.  Also market some recommended lubricants for each.

Well, it would be a miracle if it isn't already 'a thing' somewhere.

Does need a standard track for MP4 and other video streaming standards.  Tracks can be added to most video formats.  So it doesn't necessarily have to be internet enabled in the driver software.  Just a video player that recognizes the extra data streams.  Something that could probably be easily tacked into Firefox or other open source browsers to get started.  More complex to get it standardized across web browsers.  May be something suitable for an 'app store' program that encapsulates a web browser to select multiple streaming web sites.",qjz3iu

Virtual chat mobile app idea,0,"The mobile app would be a chat app with WhatsApp like functionalities. The only difference is that the conversation screen would be a virtual room similar to video games like chat rooms. Each user will create their own virtual character using the memojis technology built into smartphones upon login into the app (future state could be in-house development of custom virtual characters).   
To make the conversation more interactive, user would have the option to choose statuses (online, away, traveling, sleeping etc..) to let other contacts know about your availability. Depending on the status selected the virtual character would change accordingly. For example, if you choose sleeping status your avatar would display as sleeping and so on.   
To monetize the app advertising could be used but in order to not disrupt users with popups and whatnot the ads would be displayed either on the memojis character itself or in the conversation background. For example: if the ad is for a clothing company, its logo would automatically display on all the characters (for the duration of the contract). Another monetization stream could be the sale of virtual characters' skins like in video games.

My Product Today Discuss The ABC’s of Successfully Getting Your Product Ready for TV,0,"“You can have the greatest product, service or idea in the world. But, if you don’t get it in front of the right people at the right time, you have nothing.”   - Bob Circosta  


When you think about TV shopping, names like OxyClean, Chia Pet , PedEgg and Snuggie might come to mind. And while all of these products, all inventions of the last 50 years, seem to be as different as night and day, they do all have one very important commonality: all of these products were introduced to the consumer using direct response television, or DRTV.  


So what exactly is DRTV? It is simply television advertising that directs the consumer to react immediately to purchase a product or service, usually by phone or through a webpage. In other words, it’s the infomercials and home shopping channels you see on TV every day. And while it may get irritating being interrupted in the middle of a favorite show, DRTV works.  


I’m sure you remember the commercials for all the products I just mentioned. I mean who could forget the Cha-Cha-Cha Chia jingle, or grass stain removal demonstration showing the power of OxyClean, or all the testimonials of super- soft soles after watching countless people scrub their feet with the PedEgg?  


Because of the successful marketing to the masses via TV, each of these products has become a household name. You no longer have to order them over the phone or online after seeing a commercial. Jump in your car right now and drive to your local supercenter. You’ll see them lining the shelves.  


Yes, the TV is a powerful medium. After all, there are 302 million household television sets in the U.S. and the average American spends approximately 5 hours a day watching one. In my house it seems there is always a television on in any given room, whether it’s being watched or not. I’m guilty of using the tube for background noise every day. So whether we’re conscious of it or not, we are constantly being inundated by information spewing from the television. In fact, nearly two-thirds of all Americans report regularly seeing infomercials, which is good for sales since, on average, viewers have to see an infomercial at least three times before the final purchase decision is made.  


As an inventor you probably dream of one day seeing your product on TV, whether in spot ads (30-60 second commercials), in longer segments like an infomercial, or on a television shopping channel, such as HSN, QVC or Shop NBC.  


You’ve seen proof with products such as the Snuggie TM and Chia Pet TM that your own idea can indeed one day be seen on TV. And if you market to the right masses, your product could be one of the more than 1,000 different products being sold to a reported one out of every four Americans through DRTV each year.  


If these numbers aren’t enough to convince you of the effectiveness of DRTV, consider the following: In an average month, 300,000 infomercial spots appear on approximately 36 national cable stations and 1,800 broadcast stations, according to Elissa Myers, president of The Electronic Retailing Association (ERA). HSN alone delivers an assortment of exclusive products, broadcasting live 24 hours a day, seven days a week, 364 days a year, reaching approximately 96 million homes.  


Today, home shopping is so popular that it has become a 12 billion dollar industry in the U.S. And because people keep tuning in to find and buy the latest and greatest products, product placement on home shopping channels has become extremely competitive.  


After asking “TV’s Billion Dollar Man”, Bob Circosta, tips on how to get a new product on TV, I’ve learned that television shopping channels are looking for products that are currently manufactured and ready to go. An idea is one thing; a finished product, another. Your product has to be ready to be bought in order for it to sell.  


Yes, the thought is daunting. But don’t for one second think the PedEggTM, SnuggieTM or Chia PetTM was anything but a dream.  


You may be feeling overwhelmed, thinking there are a billion steps to take getting from A (conception) to Z (seeing your product sell). And, quite frankly, there are; being an inventor is no joke—something you know already. Each day you find a different set of obstacles to face head-on and overcome. I doubt there is an inventor out there who has never considered throwing in the towel. Despite upset after upset, successful inventors are those who maintain focus and never lose site of the finish line.  


“I believe there is one driving force in making any dream come true—and that’s you,” says Circosta, who sees success stories of inventors every day. “Don’t accept what you have,” he advises, “expect what you want. All this expectation starts in the form of a dream.”  


So just how do you keep your mind on the right path? Throughout Circosta’s experience, he has taken notice of three core focal points that thriving entrepreneurs share. He calls them the A-B-C’s of success: Attitude, Belief, and Commitment.  


Attitude  
We’ve all heard before that attitude is everything. Well, it is. The world is full of Debbie Downers, people who try to discourage us by focusing on why our ideas won’t work. As an inventor, you need to learn to block out the negativity.  


“Don’t ever let anyone else tell you what you cannot do,” says Circosta. “Once we have established our dream, we come to the realization that it takes an enormous amount of energy to make that dream come alive. If we are surrounded by people that are not helping us feed our dream, then these people become energy-drainers in our lives.”  


So often an inventor will abandon an idea because of a minor hiccup, thinking, So-and-so was right. This was a bad idea. It might seem easier to give into the discouraging words than to persevere. Don’t get caught in this trap.  


To maintain your positive attitude, Circosta suggests you focus on one big reason why your idea will work. Anytime you’re faced with opposition, you can think back on this reason while imagining the contributions you’ll be making to others’ lives once your idea becomes a working product.  


Belief  


One of my favorite quotes of all time was spoken by Sophia Loren. She said, “Nothing makes a woman more beautiful than the belief that she is beautiful.”  


You’re probably wondering, “Just what does this have to do with me, an inventor?”  


Let’s take a moment to consider the idea from Circosta’s viewpoint. He says:  


Belief in something means having confidence. Having confidence allows people to perceive you as genuine. Being genuine makes you credible. And credibility is everything to the success of a sale—whether it’s an idea or a product being sold.  


Who would catch your eye on the street? A person walking tall, chin up? Or someone with slouched shoulders, staring at the ground? The bottom line is: if you don’t believe it yourself, no one else will.  


This is not saying you have to exude arrogance. Always remember: you need to embrace resilience. If you accept that nothing is going to go exactly as planned, that there could be setbacks early on, you will be much better prepared to face any bump in the road—without a chance of bottoming out. If you continue to believe in yourself and your idea the horizon will seem a lot closer.  


And, even though it may be hard to hear, if you don’t believe 100% that your product is feasible, perhaps it’s time to shift your focus to something new.  
Commitment  


Commitment is all about having a never-say-die mindset. As previously mentioned, you will encounter roadblocks, but you have to commit to turning your dream into a reality no matter how difficult it gets. When the going gets tough, the tough get going, right?  


In his training sessions held around the country, Circosta often asks his audience why the household cleaner “Formula 409” has that name. It’s because the first 408 formulas weren’t as effective.  


You might not have to try 408 different times to get your product perfect, but chances are you won’t get it on the first try. Even knowing where to start can be a challenge. Before you dive head first into your idea, spend some time thinking about your goals, researching what you have to do to achieve these goals and then document all of the steps you’ll need to take to get there. For example, what kind of licensing do you want to obtain? When does this need to be done? What about prototyping? Do you need a prototype to get a trademark? Figure out the details then create a schedule for yourself.  


“Without a well-documented course of action, inventors tend to lose sight of where they’re headed. They start to get overwhelmed about knowing what steps to take next,” says Ricardo Valderrama, CEO at [My Product Today](https://myproduct.today/), a US based firm specializing in assisting inventors get their products to market. “It’s always a good idea to take the time to make a detailed plan.”  


I’m sure you’ll agree it’s much easier to follow through with a commitment if you have a plan.  


So as you get your product ready for TV, always remember what Circosta says, “your will is more important than your skill.” And your attitude, belief and commitment are major players in your journey to success.

Social Anxiety VR App,1,"How about a VR application that provides immersion therapy for those with social anxieties?  

The app would be first-person, like most VR.  There could be a wide assortment of social situations in which you could place yourself, one-on-one or in groups.  Chat with a friend.  Ask someone out.  Go on a first date.  Sing in a coffee shop.  Ask your boss for a raise.  Give a speech in your classroom or town-hall.  Act in a play.  Give a toast at a wedding.

The realism of these interactions could be on a gradient.  Early levels could place you before a rough outline of a person with a blank background.  Higher levels would be more life-like and immersive.

The difficulty of interactions could also be graduated.  A smiling boss that responds positively is easier than one that is preoccupied, or even hostile and belittling.  

Being put in these situations within a controlled environment is what immersion therapy is about.  This above would be helpful enough.  But what about feedback?  

First, interacting with others will need to be truly interactive.  I’m not up on how sophisticated the technology has gotten in this area since the chat bots of my youth.  I’m sure AI has, or will, make progress here.  Short of that, things may have to be more scripted, or allowed to be more absurd.  

Practice itself is great, but could there be some success measurements?  Biofeedback (heart-rate, skin conductivity)?  Can your voice be analyzed (volume, clarity, shaky, speed)?  Can the content of your speech be analyzed (“umm” or other filler frequency, passive vs active, self- vs other-focused)?

Could you be scored on reading/missing social cues?  Maybe you kept hitting on someone who was giving cues they weren’t interested.  Maybe you interrupted.  How much did you dominate the conversation, or not respond enough?

Don’t know if this exists, or is frequently discussed. What’s missing?  I hope something like this comes to be.  One could finally give a speech in front of an audience that’s literally naked.",rlw9uw
Political War Social Media App,3,"Increasingly, over the last few year, I noticed that people regard their political beliefs more like teams than actual thought-out ideas. Similar to football fans, they hate the other team and support their team no matter what. Then, why not capitalize on it? Twitter kinda does it but in half-assed way. 

So, my idea is to create a social media app where you can follow your favorite political teams such as (Communism, Anarchism, Conservatism, Populism, etc) and concurrent news will be presented daily. Each team has a forum where they provide their opinion on the matter at hand. Then, for each news story, you can check the most voted opinion from each team which will kinda act like the voice of the team. Therefore, other teams can provide a rebuttal to the to top most voted opinions from other teams and fight. 

Opinions are not limited to comments, but also short videos explaining their opinion on the news. 

Obviously, in terms of the marketing strategy and optics for the app, the app will present itself as market place for all people and ideas where conversation and arguments occur to reach the best solutions on current news.",rsko9m
App for Gout & Kidney stone foods,1,"I’ll try to give a short and sweet summary as I have questions that people may have solutions to. Any and all feedback appreciated.

I currently have gout & previously had kidney stones. Biggest change that immediately occurs is diet & water intake. 

A large amount of misinformation and confusing data, one website says eating x is okay when you’ve had stones or gout, the second link will say the complete opposite. 

The more direct information (for my type of stones etc & gout) is to eat foods that do not raise uric acid levels (this is caused by purines) 

I’d like to be able to scan the barcodes of food, or just search (because a family friends dinner won’t have a barcode) something along the lines of my fitness pal, the problem from research that I’ve found is that the data required isn’t included in a large amount of foods in the barcode data.

I’ve searched for databases with APIs trying to find this information but no luck so far.

- What are other means possible for attaining this information? 
- is there possibly other metrics that can be used to measure if a food or drink is suitable for a users condition?
- Huge milestone but is there a possibility to have it reviewed by health organisations to gain some form of accreditation for accuracy or approval?",rshsa3

Custom desk idea,1,"So let me start by saying I have no idea if something like this already exists. I’ve never invented anything before and would love to get some help, maybe some partners involved. But here’s my idea:

As someone who loves to play video games, I spend a ton of time sitting at a desk. A few issues I’ve run into with every desk I’ve ever owned:

1. What you buy is what you get. If you want to add something, you need to buy a new desk.

2. If a part breaks, you need to get a whole new desk.

3. Lack of customization. Most desks are cookie cutter designs. I imagine it would cost extra money to have a desk designed perfectly for your space.

My solution: (No name for idea yet)

Imagine the outer frame of the desk is metal bars, with slots running all the way down on every face (just outer frame, the desk can still have a wood desk top). Now these slots are key, I’d like to design them in a way that I can patent it the design. But basically the slots will allow you to buy different parts and pieces to completely customize your desk over time. Every part would have a side with inserts that fit into the slots (think similar to legos). Want to add a shelf? Buy the parts and just snap them together. Want an insert to add a slidable monitor mount? Buy the parts and snap them on. Part of the desk breaks? Just replace the broken parts. The possibilities could be endless.

I probably did a terrible job explaining it but I hope I got the point across. I have more to add to the idea, but this post is already getting very long. So feel free to reach out! But I’d love to hear everyone’s input!",rv7klb
At home leaf incinerator/water filter concept.,1,"Hi, my Midwestern residence has several 60+ year old oak trees on the property. They tower over the neighborhood and are so majestic and beautiful. However, when it's fall I spend DAYS managing the ever falling leaves. It's the bane of my existence. There are too many to mow up. Too many to haul away. Literally buried up to our tits in leaves.

So I've tried several different ways of managing them. The city dump in my town charges ridiculous rates to take them. All garbage pickup companies have to change their rates to make a profit. Pretty sure they just incinerate them anyways. Right?

So here's my idea. At home incineration. I have seen designs for smokeless barrels. I understand they are usually illegal. (Will cross that bridge when we get to it.) My IDEA is to build a better incinerator. One that somehow manages the extreme heat, leaves, waste, smoke in a safe way. Probably a big ask. But then I remembered something. BONGS AND BONG TECHNOLOGY. Can an incinerator be designed that somehow filters the leaf smoke through a water tank/reservoir? I imagine something like that giant gravity bong that Seth Rogan has. I just don't know enough about bongs. Is it still considered smoke that comes out the other end? Or is it more of a vapor.

Here's my other question. It gets cold AF in my Midwestern town. Specifically in my garage/shop. I have electric heaters and propane space heaters. Yet EVERY fall I am paying and managing massive amounts of leaves. AKA FUEL! Wish I could just save all the damn leaves somehow and convert them into heat in the winter. 2 birds with one stone. idk. Convert them into pellets somehow? 

TLDR: CAN WATER PIPE TECH BE EMBIGGINED TO HELP ME INCINERATE ALL THE LEAVES IN MY YARD. 

TLDR 2: CAN LEAVES BE STORED AND BURNED FOR HEAT IN THE WINTER EFFICIENTLY?

Thanks for your help and consideration. Let's discuss.",rv4nr8

 I thinking of buying barbells from Nantong Leeton Fitness Co., the #1 ranking company on Alibaba for the term ""barbell"". Is Nantong Leeton Fitness Co. the right supplier for barbells? Answer: No. They are a big company but primarily sell resistance bands. Thus, they likely outsource their heavy metal work creating a more costly and potentially worse product.
 Who are the top companies & suppliers who import/export under HS Code 42.02.92 -- trunks & suitcases?

I created ImportYeti because these bill of ladings are public information and nearly everybody in overseas importing supply chain positions I know uses expensive alternatives to ImportYeti.

Understanding the right factories to choose in your supply chain, can decrease a ton of headaches. It would be my hope that people don't use this to ""copy"" competitor products. There are already enough product clones floating around the internet. Rather, I'd love to help people understand which factories to use versus just blasting out e-mails on Alibaba, trying to intelligently decide which factories to visit, walking into a trade show blind or relying solely on connections with your existing factories.

I'd love any and all feedback (love or hate)... no matter how brutal, small or crazy : ) I only want to create things that people really love.

First, would love some feedback on a POC that I had an idea for the other night. It’s a bit of a ramble, the the soul of the idea is there (link below). This topic has been something I’ve been thinking about for the past while, and doing something like this might help to take a step forward in the journey.

The fairest student loan forgiveness of them all?,21,"So I constantly think about how to be fair when it comes to student loan forgiveness. Let's be honest, its coming. The hardest part is deciding what's best for everyone. 

Here's my idea:

For government sponsored loans, the government forgives the interest they have charged you on those loans for the life. So if you paid 50k in interest over the past 10 years, that's what you get. If you just got out of school in 2020 and basically have had no pain or interest paid, you get nothing. 

No free hand out. Just giving us back the money that they took from us ( for me it's 6-7% interest for the past 6 years.). Give me my check biden!!",rojoyg

Service that provides tours & excursions,2,"Nowadays people are traveling alone and don't use any services or guided tours.

My idea is to make a platform where everyone could make a profile and write: ""I have been living in X for 20 years and I know places that I can show you"". It's like airbnb but with people and excursions.

It can be helpful for students if they want to earn some money or practice the language they are learning. But there are more benefits for tourists. It is a great way to make new acquaintances, you can immerse into new culture and speak with the ""guide"" and learn more about the culture than from the Internet.

This one's for the car guys,0,"I like cars. You like cars. We all like cars. Especially fast and furious ones! I find it unfair that we have to limit ourselves based on the poor driving of normies in their dumb SUVs and faux-luxury sedans. And not to mention so many bullshit regulations on molded cars and imports because of ""Safety""

There is no other community in the world that values safety as much as the motorsport community does! Role cages, helmets, 5 point harnesses, adjusted steering for better handling, bucket seats for safe control, fire extinguishers. Those things are like trophies to us and anyone who has them are seen as gods. So I find it bullshit that I'd get a nice, new r34 spec crushed because it doesn't meet 33 year old safety guidelines, when I can make it safer than 3 year old safety guildines! (I have yet to see a consumer car from factory that already has a roll cage on it. Just sayin)

Now, this is is where my idea comes In for us. I believe we should have a specialized liscence for car enthusiasts and our suped up street cars. This liscence will give access to imports that don't meet certain regulations necause the liscence would prove we are more than responsible and knowledgeable enough to own them. There could be after hours times where speed limits don't apply to people with this liscence between certain hours of the night, I'm certain areas where traffic is damn near non-existent. 

There would be a special test that people who wish to obtain the liscence can take that is much harder than normal (so idiots in lifted Sierras don't get them). There can be an even higher age limit, let's say 21, and more time behind the wheel without infractions or citations (I wouldn't even be old enough to obtain it for another 2 years, so you know I'm serious!). Punishments for road infractions before after hours would be a lot harsher due to the expected responsibility of these special-liscensed drivers. Things like DUIs, Hit and Runs, and other serious offenses would have the liscence revoked for very long periods of time, or even permanently, depending on the offense.

Now, I know what you're thinking: ""how are cops gonna know if you have the liscence? They'd have to pull you over regardless, and that ruins the purpose""
To that, I have a few solutions: maybe put a qr code on the vehicles that speed readers can identify and ignore during after hours. Don't want the sticker? Then leave it to the registration office. Have your liscence plate be the identifier of an after hours vehicle, so if a cop is suspicious, they can tail you, track your plate, and if it clears you, they'll fuck off. Or, even more, After Hours drivers can call their local PD ahead of time to clear themselves and any participants in any rallies, meets, street races, etc. That way, it gives the organizers more personal liability and more of a reason to keep everyone in check and be more responsible.(so you don't have mustangs trying to kill crowds coming out of the lot)

Another concern I can see popping up is the common rebuttal of ""If YoU wAnNa DrIvE fAsT, KeEp iT oN ThE tRaCk""
If you're the kind of person that says this, please stop talking and take your base model Hyundai Sonata elsewhere. Not everyone has access to a dedicated track, and not every track is open or suitable to every driver's tastes. There are backroads that are rarely traveled down, and people may just want a quick 30 seconds down an empty highway where no one is around but themselves. If they crash Into themselves, it's their fault. People want to use an empty parking lot for some quick donuts and what not, so let them, so long as they are impeding traffic and have taken the measures to make sure no one uninvolved is hurt.

That brings me to my next point/ concern. ""What if other people get hurt by these After Hours drivers?"" The drivers will be directed to take every measure possible to ensure no other people are injured by After Hours activities. That means shutting down roads in advance (if allowed by their county/state). That means letting other After Hours drivers if anyone is coming into the general area and could be harmed, which would in turn prompt others to temporarily halt their activities. That means no speeding or swerving on busy roads. This is 9nce again, all driver liability, and measure that proper street racers and car enthusiasts would be MORE than happy to take! There can be different insurance policies that incentivises the drivers to be more cautious and responsible. Different regulations that apply to modded and imported vehicles.

That's all I have off of the top of my head, but if you have any questions, comments, or concerns, I would love to hear them! And spread the word if you could, because I want this to become a real thing!",rygn1o
A movie theater ticket auction system,1,"The ticket prices are at the same level pretty much the whole time. It changes probably year to year. But some movies are in way higher demand than others. In this system we have a situation where there's a lot of people who would be willing to pay more to see a movie earlier, and on the other side we have people who would gladly see the movie weeks after the premiere, but the ticket prices are to high for them even in that situation. I have asolution to translate that demand onto the ticket prices.


It works like this: it's an online system where you lock in your debet card, you pick a movie theater seat and you bid how much you're willing to pay for that seat. If you bid the highest at the end of the bidding process, the payment is made and you get the ticket. 


Why lock in your card? To prevent trolls who would sabotage the system by bidding billions of dollars. If you decide to troll anyway by bidding over your balance, the system will give the ticket to the next person in line who has the required balance to pay for the ticket. The bidding could start at a level at which the theater makes a profit, let it be 2/3/5/whatever dollars. You didn't get the ticket at the maximum price you're willing to pay? Later starts the auction for the next hour/day. The bidding price could be public so people can see live how much are people bidding at any given time (the bidders' data would obviously be hidden). 


I'm not Amaerican, I don't know if there's any regulations preventing such system to be implemented, but if there is one, try to analyse my idea regardless of that.

Semi medieval armor sweater,2,"I saw online these cool looking sweaters with a knight's helmet. I bought one and they were terrible quality. The face cover was a thin flappy piece of fabric  held by two small buttons that attached to the hoodie. That is when I got the idea to make this product better by using hard cardboard or plastic and use a fabric sleeve to hold the shape. Then I thought what if I made other sweaters with the same concept but from different media like a sweater that makes you look like some one from dark souls or bat man, etc. I don't know how to make clothes, but i plan on learning the basics this year. If anyone has a better idea on how to make my idea happen let's chat.",rwq7t8
