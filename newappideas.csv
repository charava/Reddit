A way to make android gaming controls more usable and similar to console.,0,"Is there a way to use the movement of your device to trigger onscreen buttons? Let's say you are playing an emulator and the original console controls required the use of 4 different inputs at once. Two thumbs and then a finger on each trigger. Many games use controls like this, and it's why playing shooters on the phone feels so clunky. When using on screen controls you can only use your two thumbs thus making it uncomfortable to properly play. For example take Minecraft. You look and move around with the joysticks, then attack or place blocks with the triggers, enabling you to simulataniously move whilst interacting. This is a critical factor in immersiveness and general playability of the gaming experience. When your control inputs are limited as they are on touchscreen devices, it forces games to adapt and change, often making console ports hard to enjoy, however creating an interesting variety of unique controls for other games that perhaps were originally designed around this flaw.

Specifically targeting emulators and console ports; games not designed around this flaw in controls, in my opinion this side of things could really do with a way of getting around this problem as it would vastly improve the enjoyability of playing (proper) games on the phone. My solution involves using the accelerometer & gyroscope to detect when the phone was being tapped on the top corners or back, and then mapping these input signals to control a touch button on the display, thus creating artificial trigger buttons for your emulator's.

You would simply hold the phone in a landscape position in a similar way to how you would hold a regular gaming controller, with your fingers resting on the top left and right corners of the screen. Just give them a good tap and that's your button. Surely the phones sensors are sensitive enough for that to be enough to trigger an onscreen reaction. Granted, this would not be a perfect solution as it would only really allow you to tap the triggers and not hold them down, however this could surely be somewhat mitigated by using a combination of all of your phones sensors to detect a purposeful input. The microphone would be able to detect a sound transient upon contact, as well as your gyroscope detecting subtle movements in orientation. Perhaps an extremely subtle flick of the phone toward whichever trigger you wish to press, in conjunction with the tap detected by the microphone, would be the best way to grant this method consistentcy as well as true functionality, via the added support of several sensors working together to detect intentional input.

Would this work, and is it already simple and easy to do with apps currently available?",rbs5ja

Looking to develop a team focused exercise tracker.,1,"My friends and I get involved in various exercise related charity challenges and enjoy them but then the challenge ends and we lose access to the charities cool exercise tracker and we all go back to doing nothing. I've tried to find a suitable tracker out their but haven't been happy with them so I'm looking to make (or have made) some kind of team exercise tracker.

I have a little survey that will take up to 15 minutes to find out what people want in this space. If it sounds like something you're interested in or might have ideas on could you please complete this basic survey? There are no rewards for doing the survey other than you get some say in how it will be built and you can opt in to hear when it is developed. Also open to any suggestions as comments to this post instead.

Not just any other dating app..,0,"üí°Got another app idea, not sure if it‚Äôs a thing or not:

A dating app where people leave reviews of you after having dated you (probably should only keep the most recent 3 years or something). Potential prospects could pay more for x-rated details like good/bad in bed (with a summary or detailed passage explanation). You get to rate with stars and you‚Äôll have a rank of 1-5 stars as well as a recommend/wouldn‚Äôt recommend dating. Reviews would be kept anonymous. The details would be up to the individual as that‚Äôs your choice what you‚Äôre willing to share as it could potentially expose who you are.

An app that tells you when an NSFW scene is coming up in a movie.,16,"Here me out right, you in a theater watching a P13 or R rated movie with your parents and BOOM a big 45 and half second, full on nude, rough sex scene with loud moaning comes on and catches you off guard.

What now, you have to sit there, awkward as hell, with a possible boner and wait it out while your parents are right next to you and your dad bumps you on the shoulder saying ""you like it, don't you üòè"" OK maybe not the last part haha. But still.

This app would be the ultimate life saver called ""NSFW Saver""

So you click on the movie, time you are watching it and the app will vibrate in a certain pattern to distinguish it from a regular notification. That will let you know what's good what's good, you should leave to the bathroom now or where you want to go. Then the app will vibrate when that scene is over, so you can go back to your seat.

Yes there may be more then one NSFW scene. So your parents may question

""Why you're going to the bathroom so many times during the movie?""

""Uh... I'm very gassy.""

Or

""You seem to have left the theater at the exact times that a sex scene was going to happen....""

""I don't know.... uh coincidence I guess.""",r8fzf8

App that shows how other people would say something:,2,"Almost constantly we hear people respond with boring phrases such as ‚Äúthat‚Äôs so cool‚Äù, ‚Äúwow- really‚Äù and ‚Äúnot much, you?‚Äù. The truth is, this type of dialog is boring and adds nearly nothing to a convo. Most people, even if they‚Äôre interested in the conversation, can lack the creativity to say a tailor made reply. 

     That is where this app would help change that. A vocabulary of words is no good if they can‚Äôt be arranged into a vocabulary of phrases. People will often lack a reply and resort to something they say frequently, then ask themselves: ‚ÄúHow else could I have said that?‚Äù 

     This has the potential be a very good network app- if designed correctly. My vision would be a simplistic and minimalist ‚ÄúReddit‚Äù style chat room, where a phrase or question can be posted between quotations. Other users can then post on the phrase how they would say the phrase in they‚Äôre own words. 

     Posting responses will give a string of comments in order of the best user rated synonymous phrase. Any question, phrase or one-liner could be posted, helping people improve their vocabulary of things to say daily during conversation.",rf53e7
Request: iOS app that allows you to use iPhone or iPad as Sony Camera monitor through lightning cable,1,"We invest a lot of money in our Sony cameras at all professional tiers, from the under $1,000 mirror less cameras to the big sensor cinema cameras. We also invest a lot of money into our phones and tablets. Then, we spend more to purchase monitors (the ones that attach to your camera, not your computer) that we can use in various ways with our cameras.

The hardware in our iPhones and iPads are more than enough to handle anything a professional monitor could do and even has editing apps that have a lot of the simple editing features that simple videos that only need, like Adobe rush or even iMovie. 

In addition, the ability to use the iOS device as an SSD would be amazing too, as it would cut down on a lot of extra steps in workflow and create instant iCloud update. But with all that, the monitor part seems like something that should already exist.

Sony‚Äôs imaging edge app is insanely horrible with my a6400 and is missing some of the features that only exist on the camera‚Äôs touchscreen for some reason that many of you could definitely explain better than me. I believe this could be because of the camera‚Äôs limitations and the fact that it‚Äôs through Wi-Fi rather than wired.

Unionization as a service,7,"Provide easier routes to start a union, possible features might include:

\- Easy access to organizers who can reach out to other employees within the company and begin organizing without the initiator worrying about retribution (or dealing with work politics)

\- Anonymous (but still verified) chat groups where employees can organize without worrying about screenshots and identities being leaked to management

\- Report, document, and publish union busting tactics

\- Election petition filing

\- Fundraising

\- Connect organizers with marketing resources for larger campaigns

EDIT additional why:

Now that we live in such a politically polarized environment it's extremely taboo to bring up subjects that relate to politics or political identity. This has a paralyzing effect on the ability of employees to organize together and represent themselves. What are the current viable options for organizing? Walking around your office and asking everyone how they feel about unions? Sure, you could also send friend requests on Facebook to every single one of your coworkers but that has far worse consequences than simply being fired, plus you lose all anonymity. 

Organizing is really difficult and not often a skill possessed by those working generally in the labor market, nobody should be left out of the benefits of unionization because they lack people skills, charisma, or social standing. By reducing the risk for employees involved the service should give meaningful access to one of our most valuable rights.",rduoge
Taskified - Gamified Tasks,8,"I was thinking about developing an app with gamification elements for a long time.
couple pf days ago i encountered a problem with my son who didn't want to do some chores and thought about this idea:

a parent - child app where parents can post tasks, each completed task rewards the child who finished it with points, those points can be converted to rewards that parent posted also.

some user stories i thought about:
parent side:
 can assign task to all of his children or an individual.
 can add gifts / rewards to be redeemed with points
 can track task / child proccess
 can assign a deadline for a task


child side:
 can take a task disabling it to other children
 can redeem points to gifts / rewards
 can earn predetermined amount of pts for each day (or maybe day streaks or something)
 earns badges / unlock achievements / leveling up


 this educational method is a common method from the Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT)",rdhl9a
