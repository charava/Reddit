"In every form of media there is one outstanding ""life-changing"" work.",1,"I don't know if this will be taken down or not, but I don't know where else to post it. Essentially, I got this idea after disappearing down several Internet rabbit holes that every piece of media, whether it be a book, a movie, or a painting, has one or multiple instances that have the power to change one's life. I think a good example would be The Caretaker's Everywhere at the End of Time. This album is a terrifying portrayal of the decay of a brain affected with dementia, and everyone who has listened to it says that they viewed dementia, as well as their life in general, differently afterwards. Another good example would be the novel House of Leaves. While at first it seems like a boring book about a non-existent movie, it soon starts to take a dark turn as the book's contents affect the sanity of both the author and the reader. Once again, many people who have read this said it changed their perspective of the world. If anyone knows of any other examples of ""life-changing"" media, let me know. I really hope that there are more examples like this out there; I'm afraid that my theory will break down with paintings and poems and stuff like that.

A P2P torrent like personal data cloud library,1,"Download an app on your phone, personal computers, and/or home servers (maybe with settings to limit the amount of storage space used for certain devices), sign in with your own personal password, and join a pool with friends or family who have the same app. Each individual user gets an encrypted folder where all their meta data is stored and only accessable by them and is distributed across  all the devices in the pool.

This way you get the benefits of meta data while keeping that info private from advertisers. The app itself could even suggest where/how to recruit new pool members to improve redundancy. ie there's a cable provider that goes down affecting an entire region where a portion of your pool lives. However, the app had suggested you add/and you did add users from another region with a different ISP so you still have access to your meta data through your mobile providers network and these out of region pool members.",r1hs0y
"AI ""Radio host""",1,"So the other day I was listening to some music on my spotify and towards the end of the track it did that thing where it overlaps the current song with the next one and essentially makes it a smooth transition for you where you don't have to pause and wonder what emotion you're going to feel next but kinda find yourself falling into it as the one song ends and the next begins.

When this happened I had this train of thought where I wondered how we aren't living in a tine where we have an AI, (I don't know much about this stuff but just bare with me) like a Siri or whatever who essentially talks to you, tells you the weather often enough, the traffic for your specific route, your coming soon list on netflix, I dunno there so much stuff to talk about when your target market is the only person listening 

So okay, I realize this would take a lot of work and blah blah blah (also my blah blah blah is targeted at the fact that I'm too lazy to type rather than to undermine the work that goes into creating these softwares and generally creating anything...

Congressional Reform Using Ranked Choice Voting instead of empowering the speaker of congress empower all members of congress.,2,"Congressional principle of ranked choice voting issues.

You introduce a bill. People can say yes or no at anytime during the year.

If enough people say yes to something, it passes. You do not even need the 'no' vote system really. The result should be treated the same that you always need a majority of congress in it's entirety not just of those who voted. If there is a majority then those who don't vote or voted no are the same. You know this is what people want from the people who say present occassionally in protest of strong arming everything in.

New traffic laws for highways,0,"I proposed this to the wife after someone flew by us doing 100+mph while my kids were sleeping in the back.

All highways have 2 or 3 lanes today. We institute a new speed limit rule. Slow lane = today's roads current limit except there is a min speed limit included as well. So 65 becomes [50 - 65].  The next lane bumps up [65 - 75]. Third lane goes [75 - 85]. The numbers aren't critical as long as there is a logical progression upward. 
Here's the part that really matters though:
Speeding fines are jacked WAAAAAY up. I'm talking $2,000 fines on the spot, no warnings. $250 for going too slow. Or even better, you lose your license for 30 days if you get caught even 1x, and then it's a massive fine if you are caught again during the 30 day suspension. Idk, but it needs to be so incredibly harsh that it changes the risk/reward value for those who speed at 100mph. On top of this, we install radar along the highways to completely replace police having to sit and use radar guns. If radar catches you, boom. Ticket is mailed to your home. Seeing a cop on the side can cause people to simply slow down then speed back up after. Or Google maps warns them in advance. But speed traps don't actually prevent speeding, they just delay it slightly. Having inconspicuous solar radar units would be impossible to sneak by, so the lunatics would be forced to go 85/90mph max in a single lane that is always moving quickly. 
My theory is that this would actually reduce accidents because the speeders are bad, but not often the cause of the accidents per se. They crash when met with slower traffic/bad drivers. This new system tries to keep those people away from each other. And they can't weave in and out on of traffic because if you're doing 90 in the fast lane you'll be fine, but if you skip into the middle or slow lane, then you are WAAAAAY over that speed limit and get smashed with a huge penalty.

My wife hates the idea and thinks it is too. ""big brother"". Which I don't disagree with...But have also seen the estimated counts for car accidents and it makes me sick that my kids might be one of those statistics one day when they did nothing wrong and followed the existing rules. So I'm ok with a limited big brother. Plus this frees up cops to...ya know...do actual police work. Who suffers in this new system? Adrenaline junkies. Who wins? The other 99% of the cars in the road, police, non drivers who pay taxes to staff police forces. I guess mechanics would be pissed about it...sorry guys.",r01hrm

Gravity powered generators,3,"I had thus idea a while back around 2009 when worked at a wood shop and was carrying two 5 gallon buckets of laqour thinner. Anyways I looked it up at the time and there were a coupke results. One was a lamp called Gravia that when you lifted a weight it would fall and spin a rod that had an ( i assume) dc motor connected at the bottom and it lit up. That lamp used a ball screw mechanism to do that. 

A company in 2012 had a website for plans to build two huge cylindrical holes in the ground that were some how connected to each other. In each shaft they would have a weight; when one fell it would create a vacuum in the other shaft lifting the other weight to the top as it fell to the bottom. They said that this was achieved with a special device that would ve placed where the two chambers were connected.

I am just throwing this idea out there incase others are interested in experimenting with it. Some might say it cant work or that the ones that do arent that efficient or practical, but just think of the early days of electricity and generators. First electricity was just a novelty playful thing then as more people began to play with it it progressed into the first generator which people had no clue what it could be used for then.

Buses should be delivery vehicles too.,3,"So the ideas i'm hearing from places like amazon and UPS is that they want to use robots to complete the ""last mile"" and ""last 70 feet"" of the delivery process.  It got me thinking.  

Buses are a vehicle that often run a scheduled route through many neighbourhoods where deliveries and pickups need to be made.  Theres also peak and off peak times when their uses can be over or under utilized, which becomes a large waste of energy.  They also regularly connect to transportation hubs.  There is also a need to increase revenue to subsidize and lower ridership fees.  

So my proposal:   Modify a transit vehicle to have collapsible seating, use the empty space to make off-peak deliveries by smaller robotic vehicles.  Modify transit hubs to also deal with delivery logistics.  Minimize the need for a transit vehicle to only have one purpose, making it struggle to create revenue and good fuel efficiency during off peak times for passengers by allowing robotic deliveries to happen... Which coincidentally is prime delivery times as the recipients are most likely to be home as well.   

Build a delivery robot that can navigate a neighbourhood from this transit vehicle, be transported in a compact, efficient and modular way, to a transit stop to a front door, and back (bonus if it can carry a passenger!)  On top of this..  if it can make store pickups it can help retail stores connect with customers faster.  

The future of transit needs to take into account ALL of the reasons we need to travel.  Not just be a people mover, but a stuff mover too.  

In the longer term, it can be modified to handle loads of a larger size, or for specialized needs, like those in trades and services.  It can even lead to more frequent service, or even transit with more flexible route determination based on rider and package destinations.  The technology is here already, we just need to put the right heads together.",ebr9ps

Individuals with great ideas such as in this sub just ignore it after they know that it's just one of the thoughts that pass by in their daily thoughts.

Dab - Your 3D Avatar Home Phone,1,"I'm at the idea stage but would like to hear your guys input or advice on this idea. You can subscribe at [https://www.producthunt.com/upcoming/dab](https://www.producthunt.com/upcoming/dab)

&#x200B;

Introducing the Dab.

Your personal home phone for receiving and making calls with 3D Avatars. You will be able to download the Dab app to set up your device, create your 3D Avatar, receive a Dab Number to receive calls, and add friends and family.

You can put the Dab device on your work office desk, at home in the kitchen, living room, or even Bedroom. The Dab device can be your home phone and can be a fun and exciting way to communicate with friends and family without using your cell phone or computer. Imagine how many people would love to answer your phone call so they can see your Avatar :)

You will be able to control your avatar's facial expression with the app and you can send gestures and animations while in the call.

**Voice Assistant**

Danny will be your calling assistant.

You will be able to say commands like ""Hi Danny, call Mike"" and Danny will call Mike.

**Connecting Multiple Devices**

You will be able to connect to different Dab devices in your home or you can use the Dab app instead of the device. The Dab device that is closes to your phone will ring. Also, say if you are having a conversation on the Dab device in the living room but need to go in the kitchen. Your Dab device in the kitchen will automatically come on (If your phone is near it) without ending the call so you can stay connected with your friends or family no matter where you are in your home.

I would love to use something like this for my home and I wouldn't be upset if no one else buys it or if someone takes the idea. It's all about execution. I have a few friends who are 3D Artist, Mechanical/Electrical Engineers and I can get the app MVP developed.

**Would you use this for your home?**

I know that you can use AR Memoji's and Filters on apps but thought it would be great to have your own home device just for receiving or making calls with your customize 3D Avatar. If I do pursue this idea and if everyone wants to use it then I can come out with other features for it. Like, users can create their own voicemail with an animation or Dab For Businesses where you can have a second account with professional attire for receiving incoming calls from businesses and the businesses will have their own AI and work avatars.

An App That Mimics Snapchat Memories,4,"I hate social media, I think its a huge waste of time. I have successfully been able to delete every social media I have asides from Reddit (bc reddit is just different lol) and Snapchat. The reason I have snapchat still is because I have had snapchat for years, and I have so many snapchat memories on there that mean a lot to me. I want to delete the app very much so but dont want to lose those memories. If there was an app that mimicked the way snapchat memories works, that would be amazing.

I would just download all of them onto my phone, but asides from the fact that it takes too much space, I love the aspect of the dates in which the memories occurred.

I'm writing a book. to skip to the relevant part, i'm trying to write about a hypothetical extreme cold weather suit that is hooked up with a jerry-rigged heating system.

It achieves this through a series of heating elements wired to a bunch of laptop batteries. During the day, solar panels charge the batteries. The suit (in writing) can last 3 hours on a full charge. Its supposed to be cycled on/off to recharge while letting the suits insulation hold the heat in the meantime.

Looking for new application fields,0," 

Dear community!

I am looking for an application field for a new foil. Imagine you had a foil that can do the following: The whole foil can conduct electricity and seperatly transfer information. You could for example integrate LEDs and control them individually, so you can use it for lighning or even make a display out of it. Another possibility would be to use it as an alarm system, due to many sensors that need electricity as well as information. In addition, there would be a possibility of power plugs, that could be placed anywhere on the foil. Furthermore, the foil could be adapted to individual needs, it is flexible and could be cut in any form and size. The individual elements could be applied as desired. You could also use it outside, due to the fact that it is very robust.

Do you have ideas or suggestions, where the foil could find use? Have you ever been in a situation where this foil would have helped you?",qxi2kd
A chill cap for hot summer days,1,"My idea is for a baseball cap with a waterproof pocket in the top with a zip.

I imagine there might be issues with condensation and it might be hard to get the cap looking 'normal'. Maybe it would be a 'cool' new look.

Military and Luxury Planes that turn into Different Sized Hangers.,2,"\*Hangar üò≠

The fuselage *separates and the long halves spread apart along a track* underneath the wing becoming the wall of the hangar. This can even be done rudimentarily with a fuselage that fits together *with large jigsaw puzzle-like teeth* tightly bound together forming a seam running along its length at the bottom and *a locking rod* stuck through the seam of teeth that connects the fuselage.

The rudimentary idea for this (above) is very practical for a minimalistic design (that doesn't mean small). The halves open up forming this prehistoric-eque low hangar that emulates a cave modern caveman cave home design.

This idea has so many applications and tweaks though.

Instead of the fuselage separating... legs can extend from toward the tip of the wing and create more of a tent than a hangar since this design doesn't have walls.

More Barn-sized and Hangar-sized airplanes might require smaller fuselages, but that's not problematic.

Implementing joints into the wings of these crafts would allow the airplanes enhanced turning capabilities by tilting their wings. Seeing a large bird aircraft tilt its wings would look intense especially with flapping using just one joint and the ""flapping"" occurs very loose and fast, like a loose hinge flopping around. This causes it to look so futuristic and intimidating! Seeing one of these in the sky would be like something you'd see in a movie. With freaky lights too, it could be really intimidating.

Having airplanes that serve multiple functions like gunship designs or water craft, these birds have a lot of human charm to them I'd love to see come alive in both military and luxury use.

Work problems...,7,"So I work at an elementary school through Americorps right? When the schools closed down, the principal (one of my bosses) asked me to check in every day with the vice-principal, Minh. I asked if we could make it a weekly check-in but the vice principal said since principal said we gotta do every day, it's what I have to do.

Well, I did forget some days of the week to check-in. And so my Americorps Supervisor calls me to yell (rant) at me for it.

She's been very inconsistent with the requirements with this whole check-in even though I'm checking in with just the vice principal and not her. Our check-ins are separate. Mind you her job is to make sure I'm doing my job at the school which is why shes concerned with the check-in between me and the vice principal.

In April, since I forgot a couple more days, she called again. And ranted over and over how I'm not professional and even threatening to fire me because I'm being so unprofessional for not checking in with the vice principal. She told me she doesn't care what time I check in just as long as I do it? Since my work at home hrs have been so...all over the place.

Technically it was our Spring Break when I forgot that time so I didn't it was such a big deal.

Well, today she called (EVEN THOUGH I HAVE CHECKED IN every day) and RANTED OVER AND OVER how so I'm so unprofessional and how my check-in times are so late. I asked her what time does she want me to check-in? And I didn't get a specific time. So I send my daily check in to vice-principal and say ill be checking in at 1 pm every day. Then she texts me and says ""NO the requirement is 12:00pm""

She's being very inconsistent with her requirements and expectations and I'm getting sick of her threatening to fire me over this stupid check-in.

Hearing someone call you unreliable, unaccountable, unprofessional, etc. over and over. I cried during our call but I muted it bc I was trying so hard to stay professional.

She said she will not be my reference for whatever job I may be getting next...mind you, I never asked her to.

I don't know what to do. I want to report this to her boss and talk to my vice principal but I don't how to explain it to them.

I'm stuck in another country with my mom and step-father who apparently can't stop fighting each other,12,"Hi

Well, I'm originally from South America, I live there with my dad. This February I had to come to Europe, where I lived in for seven years before I went back to my country, so I could help my mom take care of my little brothers until she recovered from a serious surgery. My step-father and her are separated, he usually stays in another city because of work and then comes to the city my mom lives in for two weeks so he can see the kids. That's all good, it works for them, but quarantine messed things up, since my step-dad can't go back to the city. My mom and him fight absolutely all the time, sometimes it's over serious problems and sometimes over really small things. It has been like this since I was 13 years old (I'm currently 21), that's why they separated.

The thing is, all of this is taking a toll on my mental health and I haven't been able to go back to my country. The embassy and airline won't answer my emails. I'm getting sick of it, plus I'm starting online classes.

I don't know how I will manage to stay sane. I've tried talking to them calmly, yelling, putting on my headphones on full volume so I can't hear them, going to another room but it doesn't work since the apartment is tiny and I don't have a bedroom for myself.

I feel like i have to speak about this to someone but i feel like there really isn't anybody that is feeling the same. Similar yes for sure.  I just need to get this off my mind.

So my mom and dad wasn't like married together when my mom got pregnant but they did know each other for looong time since childhood so it wasn't like a one night thing you know. But he took off and my mom find out that he had a child coming a few moths away from my birth.  He chose not to be in my life than. So i never saw him. I had one picture of him but i lost it. 

2017 He joined to Facebook and messaged to my mom. He asked how i was doing and if i wanted to see him on Saturday. He was going to some amusement park whit my two brothers. That Saturday i had school and i had this important role to host the event there so i couldn't go. After that he didn't ask to meet again. And why he contacted my mom was and i quote ""My wife died and that kinda woke me up that everything is not forever"" he said. I friended him on Facebook too but he never talked to me, just my mom. In 2019 he posted MY name and my 3 brothers names tattooed on his fingers. And i remind you i have never talked to this man before. Few months later he post the ""In a relationship"" thing in Facebook and weeks later deletes Facebook and i and my mom lost all contact to him. He took off again. 

I'm not sad about it just mad. Because i let him to make me believe that something was going to happen but nothing did.  One thing that i kinda would want is relationship whit my brothers but than i don't want anything to do whit them or my dad. It's just all really confusing...

My close friends for three years in high school are cutting me off,6,I have three best friends throughout my high school life. After many bad experience with friendship groups and drama. I have finally found my close friends in high school which is my ex three close friends now. How it all started in my opinion and what I‚Äôm about to express is what I feel like happened and it could be different on what they have seen or what their side of the story could be. I first met two of my best friends in the end of year 7 when I was bullied with my other toxic friendship groups and when I first met them they were very nice and understanding. They would tell me they would always be here whenever I have problems and they always listened to me complain or rant about my family problems or issues in my life time. I would sometimes make funny jokes like for example how people act and stupid dad jokes. They all laughed and they would always hype me up for the jokes I made and it actually made me happier that someone could finally understand me for who I am. So then my jokes got more funnier and they would laugh more louder. After one year pasted my two close friends made friends with another girl and she joined our group and to be honest at first I disliked her and was jealous of her because she was used to be from the popular group and I hated the way she acted. While I started to feel excluded and left out of the group. So I told my two close friends about how I felt and they completely Ignored my opinion. Pretending nothing has happened. While days kept going on I stoped mentioning my problems about the new girl in our group and started to communicate with her and hang out with her more often thinking then I would be able to fit in more. But as time went she‚Äôs actually gorgeous and an out going person and I actually got closer with her more than my other two best friends. The four of us are all having fun and talk together through out our last year of high school. Soon time went out and things started to go down. My problems got worse and I would want people to listen to my thoughts I try not to always complain to them about it and I would often hear them complaining about things in their life‚Äôs and I found it equal because that‚Äôs what friends do. But then soon I found out that my friends are once again distancing themselves with me. I tired to find reason and I learn from my past mistakes in other friendship groups until I finally said it out to them that I felt left out again. Then they finally all stood up and talked about the problems but it never came to a conclusion because everyone was just crying about the situation and ranting out all my mistakes and they never talked about their own. They told me they are sick of me ranting. They are sick of my jokes because it makes them feel uncomfortable and weird about themselves. But I found it really weird because they never told me instead blaming the problems all on me and telling me how I am the person causing all the dramas in this friendship group. But that‚Äôs not my intention to cause drama. I just wanted to make them happy and laugh so all my jokes are just to make them happy when they are upset and my problems I could not talk about it again only if you guys could of told me earlier. Instead of telling me at the end the year when everyone is gonna graduate soon. They said that my problems are affecting their own mental health and it‚Äôs killing them and they are sad because they have enough problems on their mind too. But I hate the fact that they didn‚Äôt tell me and I asked them that too and what they told me was they hide it away from me thinking they will get judged about their opinions on things if they stated their opinions on things I did or said and it made me really really upset. Because I thought we were all best friends and if we talk about things and if we don‚Äôt like it you have to say it out because then none of us will change for the better. It made me feel like a shit head that I am not counted as a friend because they hide their most important thoughts in things away from me. I could still remember that day where all four of us were crying our brains out. But all their problems were targeted towards me that I am the problem and drama causer. That day was the last day of school since the school got shut down the next day because of the coronavirus going on. So none of us get to solve or talk it out. So I send them each are very very important text message and explained my wrong and hope they would accept my apology. But instead they turned really cold to me and started to lash out everything on how I made their life‚Äôs horrible and things are never gonna be the same anymore. It‚Äôs a build up problem because since year 7 they would laugh in my jokes and told me that they would always listen and be by my side when problems rises and I know people do change over time but these words hurt me the most that my friends are leaving me because of me trying my hardest to fit in. I apologised for what I did in the past to create this problem. But they never apologised for the words they said or called me. That‚Äôs what made me sad and proud at the same time. That I admitted what I did wrong in this friendship even though I think I really didn‚Äôt because it was a misunderstanding of communication since they NEVER told me what they are thinking. But I can also understand them at the same time because it‚Äôs hard to tell one of your friends about this. I admit what I did and I‚Äôm proud of that. They didn‚Äôt do it and it‚Äôs ok because everyone has their own choice. It‚Äôs their Choice to do what they think is correct and in the end they decided to cut me of. They said we can acquaintances but every time when I text them like ‚Äúhi‚Äù or ‚Äúhow are you‚Äù they Igrone me or leave me on read. I realised that just some things that caused them to turn completely cold to me. I guess In the future I will learn from my mistakes and find a true friend who will understand me better than high school.,g1r9qq

I hate my family (especially my brother) I wish he can just disappear or something,6,"I don‚Äôt want to be mean or selfish but I think I am  now because I am gonna put it here about how shitty and nasty my younger brother is. On all the shit he has caused me and made me who I am now. How many of my fucking mental health are linked from what he had done. My family were always fighting and we‚Äôre very violent with each other so since when I was young. I had many bad experience with it and I hated home. I use to think I lived in such a perfect life. Not until my brother was born. His two faced since when he was young. He would show his cute innocent side to my mum or dad or anyone in the family tree just to get sympathy and love. While he treats me and my younger sister with disrespect and hate. He would spit on me every time when I get out of the shower clean. Throw dirt on my clean washed blanket thinking it‚Äôs so fun to see my reaction. Pick his nose and wipe it at me. Bite his toe nail and throw it at me or in my room when I‚Äôm not around. Wear his dirty shoes and jump on my bed. Mess up my clean laundry. Use his dirty hands to touch me and It caused me to have a trauma that my things will never get clean if I‚Äôm around that shit head and it turned me into a psycho clean freak that wants everything to be clean. Since he is the second oldest and is the only boy in the three children I found that my love in this family were gone. I‚Äôm the oldest and in the Asian family you were expected to do many things for the family. My brother was a little spoiled brat he gets money from my dad and my grandparents since he is the only boy so he is pretty much biased around the family tree. While my younger sister is the youngest so she needs more care and you could say I was jealous that all my love and care was all gone just because I was the oldest I had to work three jobs and the money I earn we‚Äôre either taken away by my parents to buy stuff for my brother and sister. I don‚Äôt want to live such a horrible life. Even words can‚Äôt explain my feelings right now. My brother he swears a lot around the house hold and my parents don‚Äôt care because he is spoiled like I said. He would always boss me to be his slave and he will hit me  or pull my hair whenever he doesn‚Äôt like something. He takes my stuff without Permission and breaks my books destroy my makeup and items in my room. He yells all the time and one time mum and dad was always fighting about him. Such as one time when my dad cooked him noodles and he doesn‚Äôt like it and he started to throw a tantrum mum came and started to yell at my dad because of a cup of noodle on how my brother didn‚Äôt like the taste. Such a petty thing to fight for. That day I was the one who had to stop them from fighting and I was protecting my mum from my dad beating her. My brother is too spoiled and that time he was 13 years old. Still acting like a baby. When he was younger about 6 or 7 years old every time when he does something wrong I would get blamed for it since I‚Äôm the oldest and I would get hit and beat up. I turned suicidal after many beat up and harassment from my brother and parents. My brother would stole money from my parents and use it for his stupid game. He would take my parents credit card and type in the number and spend about $700 dollars on a freaking game. When he was younger he would stole candies from shops and eggs from our next door neighbours. He takes things with out permission. Every time when I‚Äôm sad I would take some animals home, such as rabbits and cat and look after them and put them in our garden.  My brother would harass my cat and play with it really rough and when my cat attacks him for it he would kick my cat. He even stole my bunny rabbit ‚ÄòPluto‚Äô and he will threaten me with many things if he doesn‚Äôt get what he wanted because my parents has his back. I would get mad at him and tell him to stop because I‚Äôm not a very patient person because I hate my brother since he was young. So some times I would yell at him and tell him to back off for all the shit things he do but then he runs off and acts all innocent to my mum or dad and I would get beat again and yelled at. I just don‚Äôt understand. My brother had stole and had break many things in this house hold but my parents just never gets mad at him rather think his doing is good. His never going to learn his lesson and soon he will be raised to be a criminal. Since he is the only boy my parents would never do anything to hurt him and he never had to wash any of his clothes or do any kind of chores around the house. Rather I had to do many things. I hate living my life like this. Really hate it and wish some days it could end.",g10x4e

Past HS drama,0,"So a long time ago in high school, idk why I ever did this I was being really dumb and I regret and I can not stop thinking about this till this day. But I had 2 friends who always talked behind their backs to me. I told my friends that both of them were talking bad about eachother and one of my friends wanted evidence because she thought I was lying. One day my friend talked bad about another friend so I decided to record the conversation and send it. Currently this is the past and these 2 aren‚Äôt friends due to other reasons but the friend I recorded knows I did this and she does forgive me. However, the friend that I gave the recording to in high school, her mom is totally crazy and she emailed my high school teacher saying my friend and I bullied the friend in high school. To this day I worry that I made a big mistake by recording the conversation and it will later impact our lives. However I know it‚Äôs just high school drama and everyone does talk behind others back. So I‚Äôm scared that the mom will like show everyone or the friend that I sent the recording to will show everyone and my other friend will be affected and so will I... 
This happened like 3-4 years ago but I still think to this day I made a bad mistake. Please give me some advice or thoughts.",g06k98

I'm at a crossroads in my life.,3,"As the title describes, I have found myself at a very clear fork in the road as life choices go. If I'm being real, I already know what I should do. That's not what this is about. I'd like very much to just lay out my situation, and get some feedback from the internet at large.  So the novel begins. My boyfriend and I (me:bisexual man, him: gay man) have been together for very nearly 4 years. The beginning of our relationship came at the heels of a devastating tragedy in the form of the loss of a my dearest and longest friend as well as the heartbreak of my very first open guy-and-guy relationship ending in me being ghosted by a long time friend of myself and my family. ""N"" (my current boyfriend and basically the subject of this post) came into my life through tinder, and we fell madly for each other very quickly. But if I'm being honest it was never much of a physical attraction, and in fact I soon found myself being the bottom (yeah we goin there) in my first real gay relationship, even after I fully knew for myself that I was a top and did not enjoy bottoming in any way. Add to all this that my boyfriend was immediately both very possessive, needy and demanding, as well as having an SEVERE anger management issue. For the first 2 or so years he would regularly explode on me, often threatening or actually committing some form of violence on me (pushing, kicking, etc.). Eventually I found my backbone,  kicked back, and things got better. I told him I am not and will never be a bottom, and with that and many other concessions, we eventually found ourselves in a relatively happy, healthy relationship. Until time happened. As we went along, I began to become less and less interested in my partner sexually, and more and more irritated with the way he treated me. Cut to us 3.5 years in, we have managed to stay together but not without at least 3 official break ups in the intervening time. At this point,I love my partner very much, and I want him to be in my life, but I know all too well that I can't spend forever with him, and since he moved his best friend in with us a couple months ago I know for a fact that we've both felt that things are not right and we may be headed in different directions. But then we ignore that ""fight"" and a month later here we are, he spends every moment not at work hangin with his friend in the living room while I hang in our room. I'm just not that social due to my anxiety disorder and I know he'd say I should just hang out there with him but I don't think its crazy for me to say ""hey, I'd rather be in my comfortable lil space and have you hang with me every once in a while there than go sit in the living room awkwardly while you guys chat it up and giggle about inside jokes."" His BF isn't my BF, and I feel like I'm losing a battle that I don't even want to fight. Any and all feedback is appreciated.",fyy9yh

A problem I had for two years,3,"Before I went into middleschool, I was a happy little kid that would always talk to others and make goofy and funny things to make others laugh. Some of the kids that I mess with don't really have a problem with me and sometimes would ask me if I would like to play games in the playground like the floor is lava, tag, and hide n seek. Other kids however (that were mostly girls), saw me as a annoying kid who does dumb things and doesn't know any better. So the girls rarely ever talked to me. Sometimes I would be arguing with some girls since they would act defensive and would sometimes tease for the things I do. Luckily I had a very nice teacher and would diffuse the situation quickly. The girls will sometimes tease me for the things, but it didn't really bother me since me and my friend would always laugh it off. But then, once my elementary days were over and I had to go a middle school for the first time, things got pretty bad.

Once my first day of middle school began, I was sort of shy and didn't really talked that much since my friend from elementary school was going to a different middle school so I had no friends to talk to. My first impression to my classmates wasn't that good, I acted pretty retarded to them as of what I've done to make kids in my elementary school laugh. Once lunch began,  
I sat in a small table were couple of my classmates were sitting in. I attempt to make ""funny"" things that I deeply regret doing like eating things of the floor, eating 
scraps of food that my classmates didn't want, and make weird jokes that weren't really funny at all. Worst part about my classmates was that some of them were girls that were from my elementary school. The girls didn't really like me at all and started spreading rumors about me that would later destroy my reputation with my classmates. Another bad thing about my classmates is a small group of ghetto kids that weren't really nice to others. Once they heard about the rumors, they pretty much started tormenting me everyday calling me names, stealing some of my belongings, and even sometimes threatening me that they were gonna beat me up. I felt powerless because of them. Around the middle of the school year, everyone was pretty much against me, they all pretended I had some disease which they called Ebola and started physically distancing themselves from me, pretty much causing me to be lonely for the rest of the school year. It gotten so bad to a point where everytime 
I sit near to ant of my class, they would scooch away from me or tell to please sit somewhere else. I would also pretend I was sleeping on the table while in reality I was quietly sobbing from all this torment I had to deal 
with every day. Onetime one of the ghetto kids was mad at me for something that I can't remember and started calling names and other bs at me. I then snapped and threw a small milk carton at him and it hit him in his. After this, he told me that me and him are going to fight in bathroom. I was pretty mad at him so I pretty much shrugged it off. Then when my class period started he came to my table and told to follow him into the bathroom. I knew what he was doing so told him no. Then he brought his friend and tried to encourage me to follow him to the bathroom. I got angry at him and quietly threw a cuss word at him. He heard me though, and got pissed off and decided to shove my workbook off my desk. Luckily my teacher finally realizes whats going and stopped the ghetto kid from harassing me. But at that point, I hit my breaking point and started sobbing onto the desk. That day was the day were my personality started to drastically change. After my school uear was finally over and I moved on to 7th grade. I was no longer that happy kid that would always attempt to make funny jokes to make other people laugh. I was now just some kid that barely talked to other.

As of writing this now, Im now a lot more energetic than before and now have friends that I would sometimes talk. But I still don't talk that much to others since I fear that they would gonna tell me to shut up or say that they don't care what im talking. Sometimes though, I would fight off my anxiety by telling myself that if they don't care about the things I say, then just move on and say something else. I would also have these episodes where my confidence to do anything just goes down the drain and their will voices of my classmates in my head telling that whatever I was doing is dumb or tell me that my opinions are dumb.

Sorry you had to hear my long ass sob story about me. Hopefully some of yall can give some advice to deal with my anxiety and these episodes I have.",fxkty1

"Is there an analog alarm clock that plays audiobooks, podcasts, and radio?",1,"I'm really surprised at how difficult it is to find an analog alarm clock that plays audiobooks, podcasts, or radio to wake you up. I don't want my phone to be in the bedroom when I sleep and I'm also not looking to have a smart speaker beside my bed because a) I don't really like the look of them and b) they feel way too connected which is what I'm trying to minimize when sleeping.

Just as important as the alarm feature, I'd also like the clock to be able to play an audiobook when I'm falling asleep. Currently, I just use my phone on the pillow which feels horrible and means I have to look at a screen to turn it off.

Does such a device exist because I haven't been able to find one?

"A blockchain system to reveal corrupted politicians, high ranking officers etc...",0,"I been thinking for a while how we can solve some of the corruption happening across the world. There are people who experience Injustice all the time, extortion from the poor. These people are  afraid to come out and share their experience and what the corrupted person did.

I think blockchain is the way to go about exposing these criminals.

Users are completely anonymous.

1 - They can submit evidence they have collected ( including the corrupted individuals pictures ) and upload it to the system anonymously.

2 - The uploaded data is sent to the verification area, where others users review the evidence and footage collected and judge it, once the post has substantial backing from the users it is placed into the main area where everyone can see and it will there forever. ( While the verification system is not perfect, it can be improved overtime. )

3 - The main area can be filtered out to search for individuals from specific part of the country / town. This can help users avoid these individuals.

Of course, this is not a perfect system and I have not thought about it at a deeper level. My technical skills are not enough to build this complex system either. But it is for sure a way we can bring forth such individuals to the public eye.",r3228v

Would a website specifically for freelance developers (to find assignments/jobs) be ideal for you?,0,"Foreword: This isn't about self-promotion. I don't know if this one is a survey. But the goal is to support freelance developers. If this post gets deleted, then it's fine by me.

Hello freelance developers (or anyone who wants to be a freelancer in the future)

I am planning to make a simple non-profit website where potential clients like a baker can post an assignment/job. They need to enter the title as summary what they want, description for more details and their email address so developers can contact them. An assignment is basically a request for freelance developers to make an app for them. It can be a website, mobile app, etc. everything related to IT development.

These assignments are visible for us freelance developers as a list (you can also filter assigments) to see and choose which one we want to work on. You can see the email address of the person who posted this assignment so you can initiate a call. You can also filter assignments based on whether if it's about bugfixes that needs to be fixed, or to extend their existing app or start an app completely from scratch, or mixed and more. And you can search assignments by keywords you're typing.

Click on one of the assignments will navigate you to the detail page. On that page, a more detailed description and contact info like email address of the client are visible. You can contact the client by email (or by phone, the project can and mostly will, evolve). And after that moment, it's all between you two: the client e.g. the baker and a developer (you). There are no middleman, no fees. You and the client discuss how the payment should be processed: by bank transfer, cash, or trade, etc. Entirely up to you. So basically, this project is more community driven. The development and maintenance support can be handled by ads and/or donation.

So this app is really simple: it provides you a (filtered) list of all the assignments of every potential client around the world, you can see and decide for yourself which one to pick, call the client and off you go. No middleman, no fees, it's now all on you and the client.

Yes there are other related services like Fiverr, Upwork, etc. but they charge you a lot, middleman standing between the two and those services is not entirely focussed on development and more. But the goal of this app is to provide all the **freedom** **to the IT community.**

**Update:** The app is halfway there. If, at the end, it turns out not to be popular, then I won't consider it as a waste. At least it will belong to one of my hobby projects.",r3p55w

An app to say bye when you die,14,"Hi :) 

First of all, sorry for my english, but I would like that someone roast the next idea and I would like to explain it the best I can.

I'm trying to taking care of my Instagram / Twitter / LinkedIn / Facebook / etc. accounts and every day I'm exposing a part of my life to a lot of people that, in some way, is interested on it. 

I made a lot of friends and contacts online (more than in the real life) and it's OK but... What happens when I die? 

I'm sure that it's going to be very difficult that a big part of ""my audience"" know it and I think that I would like to send a last email with my thoughts about life... or publish a last photo on Instagram... or send a last tweet. Don't know !

And here is the idea. An app where you can store and program the last messages that you want to publish to your social media or the last mails that you want to send. You should invite by email the people that you want to have the power of publish / send your last words, and for be able to press ""the red button"" they should send a death certificate.

What do you think about this idea? I have many ideas around it and I would be very happy to discuss them with someone :)

A strategy to fight covid19 with no vaccins and restrictive rules,0,"Is there a possibility to create a covid19 mutant in the lab? This mutant should be highly contagious but not virulent.

And then, when we get to the 3rd dimension, we get 2 new directions: up and down. However, we don‚Äôt get (the time version of) forwards and backwards. So, considering that the 4th dimension is time, there are 2 new directions, and we see those 2 new directions. This means that the only logical explanation is that we might be in the 4th dimension right now. We just haven‚Äôt yet figured out how to use the (time) backwards direction

Or I could just be wrong and wasted half an hour of my life staring into my mind",r4m5gw

A food fight restaurant.,2,"It‚Äôs pretty much all in the title. But imagine how fun it would be to go to a place that was pretty much buffet style food- not especially high quality- and eat as much as you want. 

Then at scheduled times a bell goes off and it‚Äôs a free for all food fight!

Logistically, they‚Äôd plan the bell for a time when the food trays are empty/ out too long to be any good anymore.

And the floors tables chairs etc, would need to be power washed every day lol but if someone could find a way to handle the logistics and operations this would be amazing",r4k78o

Anyone interested in beating a system?,0,"For the last 12 weeks worth of Sundays, I‚Äôve been slapping my head because I wasn‚Äôt ‚Äúmisinformed‚Äù I wasn‚Äôt informed. 

My brain can only tackle so much in a few hour span.

My lightbulb is this..

Earlier today I was sports betting and picked Eagles thinking that they should win today. 

But if I kept up with sports I‚Äôd know that there was some kind of ceremony retired some old players jersey, Blah blah. I was too busy watching football. 

üí° I would‚Äôve bet house on Giants to win. üí° 

However if you understand where I‚Äôm going with this‚Ä¶. 

I‚Äôd like to form a team and beat a system by betting with it. Not against it.

I could be overthinking it.

But I‚Äôd like to design a information system. Based on sports and betting. 

For some reason, people are very quiet about what they bet like it‚Äôs some sort of secret religion. I‚Äôm the opposite. I‚Äôd rather see people win than lose. 

If we come to terms of understanding Us against a System. That might be controlled by a form of Mafia in NFL and other sports I‚Äôd like to get the upper hand.

A cold weather phone notification display,8,"A robust but low power display (flexible e-ink maybe?) with a velcro back that will mirror phone notifications.  Something that I can stick to the sleeve of my parka or the back of my glove, so I can get an idea of whether it is worth pulling off my glove and digging my phone out of the inside pocket when it's -15¬∞ F outside.  
Will need to be low power, because batteries don't like cold.  I envision a patch like the military uses for insignia, so I can pull the device off to charge and to clean/dry the glove/parka/etc. Maybe a fat hardware button (operate with gloves on) to refresh or dismiss notifications. Also, bonus points if you can mirror Fitbit stats (HR, active minute, distance traveled, etc.)",r4ci0q
