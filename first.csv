New traffic laws for highways,1,"I proposed this to the wife after someone flew by us doing 100+mph while my kids were sleeping in the back.

All highways have 2 or 3 lanes today. We institute a new speed limit rule. Slow lane = today's roads current limit except there is a min speed limit included as well. So 65 becomes [50 - 65].  The next lane bumps up [65 - 75]. Third lane goes [75 - 85]. The numbers aren't critical as long as there is a logical progression upward. 
Here's the part that really matters though:
Speeding fines are jacked WAAAAAY up. I'm talking $2,000 fines on the spot, no warnings. $250 for going too slow. Or even better, you lose your license for 30 days if you get caught even 1x, and then it's a massive fine if you are caught again during the 30 day suspension. Idk, but it needs to be so incredibly harsh that it changes the risk/reward value for those who speed at 100mph. On top of this, we install radar along the highways to completely replace police having to sit and use radar guns. If radar catches you, boom. Ticket is mailed to your home. Seeing a cop on the side can cause people to simply slow down then speed back up after. Or Google maps warns them in advance. But speed traps don't actually prevent speeding, they just delay it slightly. Having inconspicuous solar radar units would be impossible to sneak by, so the lunatics would be forced to go 85/90mph max in a single lane that is always moving quickly. 
My theory is that this would actually reduce accidents because the speeders are bad, but not often the cause of the accidents per se. They crash when met with slower traffic/bad drivers. This new system tries to keep those people away from each other. And they can't weave in and out on of traffic because if you're doing 90 in the fast lane you'll be fine, but if you skip into the middle or slow lane, then you are WAAAAAY over that speed limit and get smashed with a huge penalty.

My wife hates the idea and thinks it is too. ""big brother"". Which I don't disagree with...But have also seen the estimated counts for car accidents and it makes me sick that my kids might be one of those statistics one day when they did nothing wrong and followed the existing rules. So I'm ok with a limited big brother. Plus this frees up cops to...ya know...do actual police work. Who suffers in this new system? Adrenaline junkies. Who wins? The other 99% of the cars in the road, police, non drivers who pay taxes to staff police forces. I guess mechanics would be pissed about it...sorry guys.",r01hrm

Dear community!

I am looking for an application field for a new foil. Imagine you had a foil that can do the following: The whole foil can conduct electricity and seperatly transfer information. You could for example integrate LEDs and control them individually, so you can use it for lighning or even make a display out of it. Another possibility would be to use it as an alarm system, due to many sensors that need electricity as well as information. In addition, there would be a possibility of power plugs, that could be placed anywhere on the foil. Furthermore, the foil could be adapted to individual needs, it is flexible and could be cut in any form and size. The individual elements could be applied as desired. You could also use it outside, due to the fact that it is very robust.

Do you have ideas or suggestions, where the foil could find use? Have you ever been in a situation where this foil would have helped you?",qxi2kd

Work problems...,7,"So I work at an elementary school through Americorps right? When the schools closed down, the principal (one of my bosses) asked me to check in every day with the vice-principal, Minh. I asked if we could make it a weekly check-in but the vice principal said since principal said we gotta do every day, it's what I have to do.

Well, I did forget some days of the week to check-in. And so my Americorps Supervisor calls me to yell (rant) at me for it.

She's been very inconsistent with the requirements with this whole check-in even though I'm checking in with just the vice principal and not her. Our check-ins are separate. Mind you her job is to make sure I'm doing my job at the school which is why shes concerned with the check-in between me and the vice principal.

In April, since I forgot a couple more days, she called again. And ranted over and over how I'm not professional and even threatening to fire me because I'm being so unprofessional for not checking in with the vice principal. She told me she doesn't care what time I check in just as long as I do it? Since my work at home hrs have been so...all over the place.

Technically it was our Spring Break when I forgot that time so I didn't it was such a big deal.

Well, today she called (EVEN THOUGH I HAVE CHECKED IN every day) and RANTED OVER AND OVER how so I'm so unprofessional and how my check-in times are so late. I asked her what time does she want me to check-in? And I didn't get a specific time. So I send my daily check in to vice-principal and say ill be checking in at 1 pm every day. Then she texts me and says ""NO the requirement is 12:00pm""

She's being very inconsistent with her requirements and expectations and I'm getting sick of her threatening to fire me over this stupid check-in.

Hearing someone call you unreliable, unaccountable, unprofessional, etc. over and over. I cried during our call but I muted it bc I was trying so hard to stay professional.

She said she will not be my reference for whatever job I may be getting next...mind you, I never asked her to.

I don't know what to do. I want to report this to her boss and talk to my vice principal but I don't how to explain it to them.

Thank you for reading this whole thing...I really could use some professional advice on this if there is anything I can do.",g2x57f
I'm stuck in another country with my mom and step-father who apparently can't stop fighting each other,13,"Hi

Well, I'm originally from South America, I live there with my dad. This February I had to come to Europe, where I lived in for seven years before I went back to my country, so I could help my mom take care of my little brothers until she recovered from a serious surgery. My step-father and her are separated, he usually stays in another city because of work and then comes to the city my mom lives in for two weeks so he can see the kids. That's all good, it works for them, but quarantine messed things up, since my step-dad can't go back to the city. My mom and him fight absolutely all the time, sometimes it's over serious problems and sometimes over really small things. It has been like this since I was 13 years old (I'm currently 21), that's why they separated.

The thing is, all of this is taking a toll on my mental health and I haven't been able to go back to my country. The embassy and airline won't answer my emails. I'm getting sick of it, plus I'm starting online classes.

I don't know how I will manage to stay sane. I've tried talking to them calmly, yelling, putting on my headphones on full volume so I can't hear them, going to another room but it doesn't work since the apartment is tiny and I don't have a bedroom for myself.

What can I possibly do? I'm genuinely desperate.",g2oc25
Online school (not serious),4,"This is very mild, and will probably make me sound bratty, but here we go. I had a science project I had to hand in, and usually my teacher would pester us to hand in every part of the assignment (understandably). But because of online school, I forgot to. I handed in the main assignment, but forgot all my research notes. Whatâ€™s stranger is that I handed in the works cited on a separate page, but had no notes attached. When I got the mark back, I noticed the big fat 0 next to the research notes. I put a lot of effort into them, so I assume I wouldâ€™ve gotten perfect. My mark wouldâ€™ve went from an 81% to a 95%, and it infuriates me. Iâ€™ve always been soft and broke down at the smallest thing, so this made me very sad, then angry, then quiet. I know this isnâ€™t even really a problem, but it couldâ€™ve been avoided if Corona wasnâ€™t happening. Stay safe, do your work, hand it in, wash your hands.

Work problems...,6,"So I work at an elementary school through Americorps right? When the schools closed down, the principal (one of my bosses) asked me to check in every day with the vice-principal, Minh. I asked if we could make it a weekly check-in but the vice principal said since principal said we gotta do every day, it's what I have to do.

Well, I did forget some days of the week to check-in. And so my Americorps Supervisor calls me to yell (rant) at me for it.

She's been very inconsistent with the requirements with this whole check-in even though I'm checking in with just the vice principal and not her. Our check-ins are separate. Mind you her job is to make sure I'm doing my job at the school which is why shes concerned with the check-in between me and the vice principal.

In April, since I forgot a couple more days, she called again. And ranted over and over how I'm not professional and even threatening to fire me because I'm being so unprofessional for not checking in with the vice principal. She told me she doesn't care what time I check in just as long as I do it? Since my work at home hrs have been so...all over the place.

Technically it was our Spring Break when I forgot that time so I didn't it was such a big deal.

Well, today she called (EVEN THOUGH I HAVE CHECKED IN every day) and RANTED OVER AND OVER how so I'm so unprofessional and how my check-in times are so late. I asked her what time does she want me to check-in? And I didn't get a specific time. So I send my daily check in to vice-principal and say ill be checking in at 1 pm every day. Then she texts me and says ""NO the requirement is 12:00pm""

She's being very inconsistent with her requirements and expectations and I'm getting sick of her threatening to fire me over this stupid check-in.

Hearing someone call you unreliable, unaccountable, unprofessional, etc. over and over. I cried during our call but I muted it bc I was trying so hard to stay professional.

She said she will not be my reference for whatever job I may be getting next...mind you, I never asked her to.

I don't know what to do. I want to report this to her boss and talk to my vice principal but I don't how to explain it to them.

I'm stuck in another country with my mom and step-father who apparently can't stop fighting each other,13,"Hi

Well, I'm originally from South America, I live there with my dad. This February I had to come to Europe, where I lived in for seven years before I went back to my country, so I could help my mom take care of my little brothers until she recovered from a serious surgery. My step-father and her are separated, he usually stays in another city because of work and then comes to the city my mom lives in for two weeks so he can see the kids. That's all good, it works for them, but quarantine messed things up, since my step-dad can't go back to the city. My mom and him fight absolutely all the time, sometimes it's over serious problems and sometimes over really small things. It has been like this since I was 13 years old (I'm currently 21), that's why they separated.

The thing is, all of this is taking a toll on my mental health and I haven't been able to go back to my country. The embassy and airline won't answer my emails. I'm getting sick of it, plus I'm starting online classes.

I don't know how I will manage to stay sane. I've tried talking to them calmly, yelling, putting on my headphones on full volume so I can't hear them, going to another room but it doesn't work since the apartment is tiny and I don't have a bedroom for myself.

New traffic laws for highways,1,"I proposed this to the wife after someone flew by us doing 100+mph while my kids were sleeping in the back.

All highways have 2 or 3 lanes today. We institute a new speed limit rule. Slow lane = today's roads current limit except there is a min speed limit included as well. So 65 becomes [50 - 65].  The next lane bumps up [65 - 75]. Third lane goes [75 - 85]. The numbers aren't critical as long as there is a logical progression upward. 
Here's the part that really matters though:
Speeding fines are jacked WAAAAAY up. I'm talking $2,000 fines on the spot, no warnings. $250 for going too slow. Or even better, you lose your license for 30 days if you get caught even 1x, and then it's a massive fine if you are caught again during the 30 day suspension. Idk, but it needs to be so incredibly harsh that it changes the risk/reward value for those who speed at 100mph. On top of this, we install radar along the highways to completely replace police having to sit and use radar guns. If radar catches you, boom. Ticket is mailed to your home. Seeing a cop on the side can cause people to simply slow down then speed back up after. Or Google maps warns them in advance. But speed traps don't actually prevent speeding, they just delay it slightly. Having inconspicuous solar radar units would be impossible to sneak by, so the lunatics would be forced to go 85/90mph max in a single lane that is always moving quickly. 
My theory is that this would actually reduce accidents because the speeders are bad, but not often the cause of the accidents per se. They crash when met with slower traffic/bad drivers. This new system tries to keep those people away from each other. And they can't weave in and out on of traffic because if you're doing 90 in the fast lane you'll be fine, but if you skip into the middle or slow lane, then you are WAAAAAY over that speed limit and get smashed with a huge penalty.

My wife hates the idea and thinks it is too. ""big brother"". Which I don't disagree with...But have also seen the estimated counts for car accidents and it makes me sick that my kids might be one of those statistics one day when they did nothing wrong and followed the existing rules. So I'm ok with a limited big brother. Plus this frees up cops to...ya know...do actual police work. Who suffers in this new system? Adrenaline junkies. Who wins? The other 99% of the cars in the road, police, non drivers who pay taxes to staff police forces. I guess mechanics would be pissed about it...sorry guys.",r01hrm

Ideas to reality ( Honest feedback),3,"So I came to realize having an idea be it an app idea, product idea, or whatever, people always have ideas but to implement it and stay consistent is where the real hustle begins. When you have a team to work with who accepts your idea and works towards the idea it becomes a success. Individuals with great ideas such as in this sub just ignore it after they know that it's just one of the thoughts that pass by in their daily thoughts. Not everyone with a great idea becomes a success and also not everyone with great implementing skills becomes successful. It is when both combine in the right proportion it leads to success

So here's where I am thinking about not letting ideas go to waste. I was thinking of an app where you can list your ideas and people can explore ideas and if they like it can be a part of it by sending a request and once the request is accepted, you can contact the idea creator and discuss and if you feel connected, you can go ahead with the idea to make it to reality.

I'm writing a book. to skip to the relevant part, i'm trying to write about a hypothetical extreme cold weather suit that is hooked up with a jerry-rigged heating system.

It achieves this through a series of heating elements wired to a bunch of laptop batteries. During the day, solar panels charge the batteries. The suit (in writing) can last 3 hours on a full charge. Its supposed to be cycled on/off to recharge while letting the suits insulation hold the heat in the meantime.

I am not an electrician. I know this is cracked out.

Looking for new application fields,0," 

Dear community!

I am looking for an application field for a new foil. Imagine you had a foil that can do the following: The whole foil can conduct electricity and seperatly transfer information. You could for example integrate LEDs and control them individually, so you can use it for lighning or even make a display out of it. Another possibility would be to use it as an alarm system, due to many sensors that need electricity as well as information. In addition, there would be a possibility of power plugs, that could be placed anywhere on the foil. Furthermore, the foil could be adapted to individual needs, it is flexible and could be cut in any form and size. The individual elements could be applied as desired. You could also use it outside, due to the fact that it is very robust.

Do you have ideas or suggestions, where the foil could find use? Have you ever been in a situation where this foil would have helped you?",qxi2kd

Take a bunch of these freezer bags with you in your cooler/esky/chilly bin and swap them out when the first one has warmed up. Great for a day at the beach. 

I imagine there might be issues with condensation and it might be hard to get the cap looking 'normal'. Maybe it would be a 'cool' new look.

Ideas to reality ( Honest feedback),2,"So I came to realize having an idea be it an app idea, product idea, or whatever, people always have ideas but to implement it and stay consistent is where the real hustle begins. When you have a team to work with who accepts your idea and works towards the idea it becomes a success. Individuals with great ideas such as in this sub just ignore it after they know that it's just one of the thoughts that pass by in their daily thoughts. Not everyone with a great idea becomes a success and also not everyone with great implementing skills becomes successful. It is when both combine in the right proportion it leads to success

So here's where I am thinking about not letting ideas go to waste. I was thinking of an app where you can list your ideas and people can explore ideas and if they like it can be a part of it by sending a request and once the request is accepted, you can contact the idea creator and discuss and if you feel connected, you can go ahead with the idea to make it to reality.

Looking for new application fields,0," 

Dear community!

I am looking for an application field for a new foil. Imagine you had a foil that can do the following: The whole foil can conduct electricity and seperatly transfer information. You could for example integrate LEDs and control them individually, so you can use it for lighning or even make a display out of it. Another possibility would be to use it as an alarm system, due to many sensors that need electricity as well as information. In addition, there would be a possibility of power plugs, that could be placed anywhere on the foil. Furthermore, the foil could be adapted to individual needs, it is flexible and could be cut in any form and size. The individual elements could be applied as desired. You could also use it outside, due to the fact that it is very robust.

Do you have ideas or suggestions, where the foil could find use? Have you ever been in a situation where this foil would have helped you?",qxi2kd
A chill cap for hot summer days,1,"My idea is for a baseball cap with a waterproof pocket in the top with a zip.

I imagine there might be issues with condensation and it might be hard to get the cap looking 'normal'. Maybe it would be a 'cool' new look.

Work problems...,8,"So I work at an elementary school through Americorps right? When the schools closed down, the principal (one of my bosses) asked me to check in every day with the vice-principal, Minh. I asked if we could make it a weekly check-in but the vice principal said since principal said we gotta do every day, it's what I have to do.

Well, I did forget some days of the week to check-in. And so my Americorps Supervisor calls me to yell (rant) at me for it.

She's been very inconsistent with the requirements with this whole check-in even though I'm checking in with just the vice principal and not her. Our check-ins are separate. Mind you her job is to make sure I'm doing my job at the school which is why shes concerned with the check-in between me and the vice principal.

In April, since I forgot a couple more days, she called again. And ranted over and over how I'm not professional and even threatening to fire me because I'm being so unprofessional for not checking in with the vice principal. She told me she doesn't care what time I check in just as long as I do it? Since my work at home hrs have been so...all over the place.

Technically it was our Spring Break when I forgot that time so I didn't it was such a big deal.

Well, today she called (EVEN THOUGH I HAVE CHECKED IN every day) and RANTED OVER AND OVER how so I'm so unprofessional and how my check-in times are so late. I asked her what time does she want me to check-in? And I didn't get a specific time. So I send my daily check in to vice-principal and say ill be checking in at 1 pm every day. Then she texts me and says ""NO the requirement is 12:00pm""

She's being very inconsistent with her requirements and expectations and I'm getting sick of her threatening to fire me over this stupid check-in.

Hearing someone call you unreliable, unaccountable, unprofessional, etc. over and over. I cried during our call but I muted it bc I was trying so hard to stay professional.

She said she will not be my reference for whatever job I may be getting next...mind you, I never asked her to.

I don't know what to do. I want to report this to her boss and talk to my vice principal but I don't how to explain it to them.

Thank you for reading this whole thing...I really could use some professional advice on this if there is anything I can do.",g2x57f
I'm stuck in another country with my mom and step-father who apparently can't stop fighting each other,13,"Hi

Well, I'm originally from South America, I live there with my dad. This February I had to come to Europe, where I lived in for seven years before I went back to my country, so I could help my mom take care of my little brothers until she recovered from a serious surgery. My step-father and her are separated, he usually stays in another city because of work and then comes to the city my mom lives in for two weeks so he can see the kids. That's all good, it works for them, but quarantine messed things up, since my step-dad can't go back to the city. My mom and him fight absolutely all the time, sometimes it's over serious problems and sometimes over really small things. It has been like this since I was 13 years old (I'm currently 21), that's why they separated.

The thing is, all of this is taking a toll on my mental health and I haven't been able to go back to my country. The embassy and airline won't answer my emails. I'm getting sick of it, plus I'm starting online classes.

I don't know how I will manage to stay sane. I've tried talking to them calmly, yelling, putting on my headphones on full volume so I can't hear them, going to another room but it doesn't work since the apartment is tiny and I don't have a bedroom for myself.

What can I possibly do? I'm genuinely desperate.",g2oc25
Online school (not serious),6,"This is very mild, and will probably make me sound bratty, but here we go. I had a science project I had to hand in, and usually my teacher would pester us to hand in every part of the assignment (understandably). But because of online school, I forgot to. I handed in the main assignment, but forgot all my research notes. Whatâ€™s stranger is that I handed in the works cited on a separate page, but had no notes attached. When I got the mark back, I noticed the big fat 0 next to the research notes. I put a lot of effort into them, so I assume I wouldâ€™ve gotten perfect. My mark wouldâ€™ve went from an 81% to a 95%, and it infuriates me. Iâ€™ve always been soft and broke down at the smallest thing, so this made me very sad, then angry, then quiet. I know this isnâ€™t even really a problem, but it couldâ€™ve been avoided if Corona wasnâ€™t happening. Stay safe, do your work, hand it in, wash your hands. I want this whole mess to be over soon.",g2nycw
"im fat, depressed and tired and imma blame it on the lockdown :)",9,"ok so this quarantine has completely fucked me over

&#x200B;

i started out with the intent to exercise, but due to my extreme procrastination that plan has been completely flushed, and i (believe i) have packed on a decent amount of fat that wasnt there beforehand. on top of this, i have insomnia, and i never take sleeping pills as they leave me with a migraine, so if i do sleep, its 4am or later. my body seems to have calibrated itself to wake up at 3pm because of this, giving me no time to do ANYTHING.

so, i need either ways to motivate myself, or very easy and quick workouts, and ways to sleep without pills.

any tips? honestly im open to try anything right now. hell, ill even try home remedies.",g26zrr

New traffic laws for highways,2,"I proposed this to the wife after someone flew by us doing 100+mph while my kids were sleeping in the back.

All highways have 2 or 3 lanes today. We institute a new speed limit rule. Slow lane = today's roads current limit except there is a min speed limit included as well. So 65 becomes [50 - 65].  The next lane bumps up [65 - 75]. Third lane goes [75 - 85]. The numbers aren't critical as long as there is a logical progression upward. 
Here's the part that really matters though:
Speeding fines are jacked WAAAAAY up. I'm talking $2,000 fines on the spot, no warnings. $250 for going too slow. Or even better, you lose your license for 30 days if you get caught even 1x, and then it's a massive fine if you are caught again during the 30 day suspension. Idk, but it needs to be so incredibly harsh that it changes the risk/reward value for those who speed at 100mph. On top of this, we install radar along the highways to completely replace police having to sit and use radar guns. If radar catches you, boom. Ticket is mailed to your home. Seeing a cop on the side can cause people to simply slow down then speed back up after. Or Google maps warns them in advance. But speed traps don't actually prevent speeding, they just delay it slightly. Having inconspicuous solar radar units would be impossible to sneak by, so the lunatics would be forced to go 85/90mph max in a single lane that is always moving quickly. 
My theory is that this would actually reduce accidents because the speeders are bad, but not often the cause of the accidents per se. They crash when met with slower traffic/bad drivers. This new system tries to keep those people away from each other. And they can't weave in and out on of traffic because if you're doing 90 in the fast lane you'll be fine, but if you skip into the middle or slow lane, then you are WAAAAAY over that speed limit and get smashed with a huge penalty.

My wife hates the idea and thinks it is too. ""big brother"". Which I don't disagree with...But have also seen the estimated counts for car accidents and it makes me sick that my kids might be one of those statistics one day when they did nothing wrong and followed the existing rules. So I'm ok with a limited big brother. Plus this frees up cops to...ya know...do actual police work. Who suffers in this new system? Adrenaline junkies. Who wins? The other 99% of the cars in the road, police, non drivers who pay taxes to staff police forces. I guess mechanics would be pissed about it...sorry guys.",r01hrm

And ranted over and over how I'm not professional and even threatening to fire me because I'm being so unprofessional for not checking in with the vice principal. She told me she doesn't care what time I check in just as long as I do it? Since my work at home hrs have been so...all over the place.

Technically it was our Spring Break when I forgot that time so I didn't it was such a big deal.

Well, today she called (EVEN THOUGH I HAVE CHECKED IN every day) and RANTED OVER AND OVER how so I'm so unprofessional and how my check-in times are so late. I asked her what time does she want me to check-in? And I didn't get a specific time. So I send my daily check in to vice-principal and say ill be checking in at 1 pm every day. Then she texts me and says ""NO the requirement is 12:00pm""

She's being very inconsistent with her requirements and expectations and I'm getting sick of her threatening to fire me over this stupid check-in.

Hearing someone call you unreliable, unaccountable, unprofessional, etc. over and over. I cried during our call but I muted it bc I was trying so hard to stay professional.

She said she will not be my reference for whatever job I may be getting next...mind you, I never asked her to.

I don't know what to do. I want to report this to her boss and talk to my vice principal but I don't how to explain it to them.

Thank you for reading this whole thing...I really could use some professional advice on this if there is anything I can do.",g2x57f
I'm stuck in another country with my mom and step-father who apparently can't stop fighting each other,14,"Hi

Well, I'm originally from South America, I live there with my dad. This February I had to come to Europe, where I lived in for seven years before I went back to my country, so I could help my mom take care of my little brothers until she recovered from a serious surgery. My step-father and her are separated, he usually stays in another city because of work and then comes to the city my mom lives in for two weeks so he can see the kids. That's all good, it works for them, but quarantine messed things up, since my step-dad can't go back to the city. My mom and him fight absolutely all the time, sometimes it's over serious problems and sometimes over really small things. It has been like this since I was 13 years old (I'm currently 21), that's why they separated.

The thing is, all of this is taking a toll on my mental health and I haven't been able to go back to my country. The embassy and airline won't answer my emails. I'm getting sick of it, plus I'm starting online classes.

I don't know how I will manage to stay sane. I've tried talking to them calmly, yelling, putting on my headphones on full volume so I can't hear them, going to another room but it doesn't work since the apartment is tiny and I don't have a bedroom for myself.

What can I possibly do? I'm genuinely desperate.",g2oc25

New traffic laws for highways,2,"I proposed this to the wife after someone flew by us doing 100+mph while my kids were sleeping in the back.

All highways have 2 or 3 lanes today. We institute a new speed limit rule. Slow lane = today's roads current limit except there is a min speed limit included as well. So 65 becomes [50 - 65].  The next lane bumps up [65 - 75]. Third lane goes [75 - 85]. The numbers aren't critical as long as there is a logical progression upward. 
Here's the part that really matters though:
Speeding fines are jacked WAAAAAY up. I'm talking $2,000 fines on the spot, no warnings. $250 for going too slow. Or even better, you lose your license for 30 days if you get caught even 1x, and then it's a massive fine if you are caught again during the 30 day suspension. Idk, but it needs to be so incredibly harsh that it changes the risk/reward value for those who speed at 100mph. On top of this, we install radar along the highways to completely replace police having to sit and use radar guns. If radar catches you, boom. Ticket is mailed to your home. Seeing a cop on the side can cause people to simply slow down then speed back up after. Or Google maps warns them in advance. But speed traps don't actually prevent speeding, they just delay it slightly. Having inconspicuous solar radar units would be impossible to sneak by, so the lunatics would be forced to go 85/90mph max in a single lane that is always moving quickly. 
My theory is that this would actually reduce accidents because the speeders are bad, but not often the cause of the accidents per se. They crash when met with slower traffic/bad drivers. This new system tries to keep those people away from each other. And they can't weave in and out on of traffic because if you're doing 90 in the fast lane you'll be fine, but if you skip into the middle or slow lane, then you are WAAAAAY over that speed limit and get smashed with a huge penalty.

My wife hates the idea and thinks it is too. ""big brother"". Which I don't disagree with...But have also seen the estimated counts for car accidents and it makes me sick that my kids might be one of those statistics one day when they did nothing wrong and followed the existing rules. So I'm ok with a limited big brother. Plus this frees up cops to...ya know...do actual police work. Who suffers in this new system? Adrenaline junkies. Who wins? The other 99% of the cars in the road, police, non drivers who pay taxes to staff police forces. I guess mechanics would be pissed about it...sorry guys.",r01hrm

Ideas to reality ( Honest feedback),4,"So I came to realize having an idea be it an app idea, product idea, or whatever, people always have ideas but to implement it and stay consistent is where the real hustle begins. When you have a team to work with who accepts your idea and works towards the idea it becomes a success. Individuals with great ideas such as in this sub just ignore it after they know that it's just one of the thoughts that pass by in their daily thoughts. Not everyone with a great idea becomes a success and also not everyone with great implementing skills becomes successful. It is when both combine in the right proportion it leads to success

So here's where I am thinking about not letting ideas go to waste. I was thinking of an app where you can list your ideas and people can explore ideas and if they like it can be a part of it by sending a request and once the request is accepted, you can contact the idea creator and discuss and if you feel connected, you can go ahead with the idea to make it to reality.

I'm writing a book. to skip to the relevant part, i'm trying to write about a hypothetical extreme cold weather suit that is hooked up with a jerry-rigged heating system. Pretty much made from scrap (Think Fallout) Basically the premise so far is I have a respirator system (think SCUBA) linked up to a powered heater that heats intake air for respiration and does not permit cold air into the system. It achieves this through a series of heating elements wired to a bunch of laptop batteries. During the day, solar panels charge the batteries. The suit (in writing) can last 3 hours on a full charge. Its supposed to be cycled on/off to recharge while letting the suits insulation hold the heat in the meantime.

I am not an electrician. I know this is cracked out.

Looking for new application fields,0," 

Dear community!

I am looking for an application field for a new foil. Imagine you had a foil that can do the following: The whole foil can conduct electricity and seperatly transfer information. You could for example integrate LEDs and control them individually, so you can use it for lighning or even make a display out of it. Another possibility would be to use it as an alarm system, due to many sensors that need electricity as well as information. In addition, there would be a possibility of power plugs, that could be placed anywhere on the foil. Furthermore, the foil could be adapted to individual needs, it is flexible and could be cut in any form and size. The individual elements could be applied as desired. You could also use it outside, due to the fact that it is very robust.

Do you have ideas or suggestions, where the foil could find use? Have you ever been in a situation where this foil would have helped you?",qxi2kd
A chill cap for hot summer days,1,"My idea is for a baseball cap with a waterproof pocket in the top with a zip.

Take a bunch of these freezer bags with you in your cooler/esky/chilly bin and swap them out when the first one has warmed up. Great for a day at the beach. 

I imagine there might be issues with condensation and it might be hard to get the cap looking 'normal'. Maybe it would be a 'cool' new look.
