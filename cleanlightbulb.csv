IDEA company,6," Why isn't there a company that invests in ideas? Like raw ideas?

Currently  the first line of investment is held by venture capitals or crowdfundings. But at the very very least they need a grown idea with a  good business plan and nobody is interested in ideas that come from  people who don't have the luxury or the time to get it to those steps.

Imagine  a truck driver. He is driving and he thinks to himself why something  that could help him with a specific situation and this is common amongst  truck drivers? Or a local man in a poor country that sees the potential  that is lying there but no one sees the opportunity and eventually poor  man forgets it and leaves it behind (has happened to me).

Some  people don't have the luxury of resources in rich countries but they do  have great ideas that can make money! It's baffling to me that no  company has been created for this purpose. If I had the money I would've  built it.

On the other hand we have these sham companies that take your money to promote your idea but nothing comes out of it.

I  think to myself if someone had money he would take ideas for free, examine them and if they were good and executable then they give the  person with the idea a portion of the shares of the joint company that  is made to promote and execute that idea.

You'd  think most of it will be useless and people will not generate enough  good material to make profit but see how successful crowdbased platforms  like twitter, facebook, reddit have become. Or how multiplayer gaming  is a good proof with regular people in the action ideas are way better  originated and it will become such a successful business.",rbvnwf

Open Source medical research without intellectual property. Etica Protocol,3,"Since 2018 I've been working on the creation of a blockchain Protocol for Open Source Medical research without intellectual property aka the Etica Protocol. [https://www.eticaprotocol.org](https://www.eticaprotocol.org)

Victor Hugo :  ""Nothing is More Powerful than an Idea Whose Time has Come""

I think the time for Etica has come, so let me share a brief presentation of Etica with you.

Brief presentation:

Etica aims to promote open source medical research without intellectual property. It incentivizes publication of research oriented papers (by professionals or not) for each disease added to the network.

Etica protocol has its own currency Etica (ETI). The protocol has a fixed inflation of about 2.5% per year. Thanks to this inflation it funds the curation rewards (for voters) and editor rewards (for creators of proposals).

It operates based on periods of 7 days. For each period a curation\_reward as well as an editor\_reward will be issued by the Protocol (respecting the 2.5% yearly inflation rate). For each period all users can submit Proposals in order to get a part of the editor\_reward  of the period. Etica token holders can submit and vote on proposals  using a staking system (They have to lock Eticas for 28 days in exchange  for bosoms). Bosoms are a unit of measure inherent to the protocol that is used by the voting system. All proposals can be voted upon for 3 weeks. After the voting duration has been passed the Protocol rewards or penalises participants based on the outcome of the votes.

The protocol is designed in such a way that only about 72% of proposals will be accepted. Thus due to open source competition the creators of proposals will have to improve the quality of their papers to get a proposals accepted by the network as things progress

The  creator of a proposal that was accepted by the network will be rewarded  with a part of the period's editor\_reward that will be proportional to  the amount of Eticas that was used by token holders to vote on the  proposal. If the proposal is rejected, depending on the level of the  rejection the creator of the proposal will have it's stack duration  increased (for instance 65 days) or even lose funds (to submit you have  to put a collateral of 10 ETI that you can lose if proposal is heavily  rejected by the network).

The  voters that vote on the wining side (can be either accepted or  rejected) will get a part of the curation\_reward proportional to the  amount of Eticas they have used to vote on the proposal. If they vote on  the losing side, their stack will be increased (for instance 84 days  longer) in proportion to the level of rejection.

Full details in the whitepaper.

The whitepaper:

The  Etica whitepaper (9 pages) describes how the protocol will operate in  details. (As Published and sent to the original Satoshi Nakamoto mailing  list in September 2019)

[https://eticaprotocol.org/viewwhitepaper](https://eticaprotocol.org/viewwhitepaper)

[The smart contract:](https://github.com/etica)

The Etica smart contract is on [github/etica](https://github.com/etica). It is a complexe smart contract that successfully implements everything described in the whitepaper  in the form of an Ethereum smart contract. If you are a developper or  you know ethereum developpers tell them to review this smart contract. I  have full confidence they will assess the quality of the code.

Reddit [r/etica](https://np.reddit.com/r/etica/):

[https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCMg5jHjEp59TKy\_0tdoeXnQ](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCMg5jHjEp59TKy_0tdoeXnQ)

Etica is all about open source and creating a community based project with nobody having specific privileges.  Even if I started to work on Etica alone,  I understand the potential  of this project, it is much bigger than me and to succeed it needs to be completely decentralised from day 1.

This is why I want to underline these facts:

1. I plan to launch Etica in coming months from scratch as soon as there will be a community
2. There will be no premine
3. Anybody joining Etica will have same rights, aka I won't have any privilege nor anybody else
4. It is completely open source
5. It is a neutral protocol
6. There is no backdoor Key or Key with specific rights
7. The smart contract will be launched on its Blockchain (a Fork of Ethereum Proof of work)
8. The initial supply will be distributed trough mining
9. Mining will stop forever once we reach 21 Million Eticas (should take several years)
10. Then only the yearly inflation of 2.5% will generate new Eticas.

This stuff is not mine, it is all about building it together. Let's become Legends and Join [r/etica](https://np.reddit.com/r/etica/)

I understand there’s significant cost to build and maintain the pipeline but water is much safer than oil and you can always sell water to those farmers who keep crying coz CA can’t give them enough.

"Lead plastic for optical use, especially for efficient light diffusers that spread light in controlled amount and angle. Or anything with high refraction index in contact with other transparent plastic. For blinders and curtains for example",1,"Surface filled with concave lenses can spread sunlight in convenient angles evenly. Surface with cones causes a ring-shape when looking at the surface and is different kind of option for softer shadows and milder light.

Light diffusion with random scattering to all directions is simple, but half of the light goes outside.

Pattern on any plastic works to some degree, but gathers dirt or needs other flat covering plastic. 2 interlocked plastic types is stronger and thinner when outside surfaces are flat. Different refractive index in plastic types causes deflection.

"Humans were God's mistake, that's why he created religion and prayer.",1,"I am an Agnostic Theist, just wanted to get that out of the way. And I'll be using He so I don't have to keep saying God. And when I say ""intelligent beings"" I mean living things that are smart enough to contemplate their own existence.

What if there is a God and He decided to create the universe, the laws of science and math, and the ingredients to make life so He could peacefully observe the universe without having to interact. Like what if He created all the laws of science and math and just made the big bang and stopped there to ""sit back and enjoy the show."" And everything after the big bang was just spontaneous ""entertainment"" to Him based on the laws He made? 

But when making the laws and the ingredients for life, He never intended to make life smart enough to contemplate its own existence. But He made a mistake and because of the laws and ingredients He designed and made, humans came to be as a product of evolution, a concept He designed.

Instead of stopping evolution and rewriting the laws He wrote, he decided to write new laws that made an afterlife and made a system or systems to help intelligent life. These systems could be interpreted as Karma and some grand system that interprets prayer and based on Karma and other factors, answered those prayers subtley so God didn't have to interfere anymore. 

He could just lay back again and watch even more. And the reason He didn't rewrite humans and intelligent life out of existence, was because He thought it would make this show we call the universe more interesting.

And since we don't know whether we are the first intelligent beings in the universe, what if this happened first with the first ever intelligent beings on a far away planet, beings that we would consider aliens, and those new laws were in place long before the existence of humans.",rks3go

"Today is Farch 1st. Happy Farch, everyone!",62,"The Farch Calendar

• All months are 30 days.

• Weeks are 6 days (bye, Tuesday).

• All 30-day months break evenly into 5 weeks.

• A year is 60 weeks.

• 60 weeks of 6 days = 12 months of 30 days = 360 days. The leftover days at the end of the year go into an extra mini-month called Farch.

• Our schedules are simpler to split up and our time is easier to manage. Weeks of the year can be divided like minutes of the hour; great for schools, team projects, salaries.

• Farch is 5 days long. The extra day in a leap year gets tacked onto every fourth Farch, making a leap Farch 6 days long.

• No one works on Farch, if they can avoid it. It’s time outside the normal year to slow down and do nothing.

• With months dividing evenly into weeks, every month starts on Sunday and ends on Saturday.

• Not Farch, though. Farch is all Saturdays.

• By keeping the months in sync with weekdays, floating holidays become locked to dates. For example, on the Farch calendar, Thanksgiving always falls on November 22nd. US Election Day is always November 3rd.

• The year ends on the solstice; December 21st on our calendar, which becomes the last day of Farch, so the days stop getting shorter on New Year’s Eve and start getting longer on January 1st.

• And while we’re at it, no more back and forth with Daylight Saving. Same time year-round.

• This system was used by the Egyptians 6000 years ago. They called their 5-day intercalary month “The Five Upon the Year,” which, when written in hieroglyphs, looks kinda like Farch.",rimtef

[App Idea] Alternative Product App. Boycott with choice and precision.,0,"To begin, Our Next Arc is a movement. We make no money, not even from donations. 

We are done doing business with entities that destroy our planet, ruin lives, and murder to protect profit. We are doing all we can to fight back and an app like this will be an invaluable tool.

If you can build it, then do it. Take full credit. We don't care. This isn't about us - this is about having a tool to fight back against destructive corporations and their financiers in a meaningful way. All that said, let's get to it.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

In order to help consumers break away from businesses that have committed atrocities, we need to make it easy for them to find alternatives to products from companies that are more ethical. 

Sustainability is great, but it's not our primary focus. Our larger focus is on draining business away from places like Nestle, Blackrock, etc, so that money can get into the hands of businesses that willingly do better. Sustainability is inevitable as a part of being an ethical business and will come in time - but it needs funding and this will help them get it.

The idea is for an ""Alternative Product Finder"" app that leads consumers to these better products/businesses/services. There are examples of apps that ALMOST get there, but don't go all the way as we need in being selective about who the alternatives are.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

App Function:

1) Any barcode can be scanned

2) Complete information is displayed about the product . This would be similar to:

[https://www.barcodelookup.com/](https://www.barcodelookup.com/) App that lets you scan 300mil barcodes and get info on the products

[https://www.programmableweb.com/api/open-eangtin-database](https://www.programmableweb.com/api/open-eangtin-database) is an API claiming it allows you to scan/search barcodes to find alternatives as well. No clue how to put this to use.

3) Alternative products are displayed. For ONA's purposes, these alternatives will be carefully selected to only display alternatives belonging to companies with a good reputation. In overall function, a close example is:

[https://alternativeto.net/](https://alternativeto.net/) Great site that lists alternatives to software and apps

4) Barcodes not in the database can be added by the user and then vetted by ONA to ensure it's a company we should support

5) App is free

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

How hard would this be? What would be needed?

I challenge anyone capable of doing this, go ahead and do it. Just let us know when you've done it so we can put it to use and promote it as much as possible. 

This isn't about me or ONA - this is about making a tool readily available to the public so we can start to fight back with our choices in how we spend our money. Please make this if you're capable and willing. We need you to do build this. You need you to build this.",rmcpjg

Your All-in-one Off-grid Power Solution | Solar Generators,2,"[BLUETTI](https://www.bluettipower.com/) is so much more than just a brand name; it is a way of life, a design philosophy, our hope for a better earth, a blue sky, and much more.



From a single idea - a portable, powerful source of electricity - we've built out a whole line up of solar power storage products for adventurers and all kinds of off-grid lives..



[BLUETTI](https://www.bluettipower.com/) Power Inc, based in Les Vegas, is the leading world manufacturer of solar energy facilities including solar generators, photovoltaic panels, and related accessories. Its energetic residential power stations launched in the past two years-AC200P, EP500, and AC300 have stood out from the promising solar solution market, and now it ventures to integrate the innovative sodium-ion battery technology into its upcoming solar products.



Recently [BLUETTI](https://www.bluettipower.com/) has announced the world’s first sodium-ion solar generator-NA300 and its compatible battery pack - B480 on its social medias



It is said that the NA300 and B480 seamlessly inherit all the style and appearance settings of its predecessor – EP500 Pro, especially four 20A plugs and one 30A L14-30 output ports driven by the built-in 3,000W pure sine wave inverter to juice up most household electrical appliances. Besides, the NA300 further outstrips the EP500 Pro’s incredible 2,400W solar input to 3,000W. It may be cited to be the fastest charging solar generator since it can be recharged from 0% to 80% in a short half-hour by 6,000W swift AC + PV dual charging. (3,000W Max. for both AC and PV)

However, NA300 provides a capacity of 3,000Wh, less than the 5,100Wh of EP500 Pro in the same size owing to the current sodium-ion battery technology limitations. Favorably, it supports up to two B480 battery modules (4,800Wh each) for a whopping total capacity of 12,600Wh, and the unit can sustain the constant supply for a family electricity needs for several days or even a week in grid failures or natural disasters with recharging by the solar panels. Additionally, NA300 also offers the 240V, 6000W connection with a Fusion Box and another NA300, IoT App Remote Control by iOS or Android, and other EP500 Pro’s merits.

[Bluetti](https://www.bluettipower.com/) is and always will prioritize design, service, and quality over everything else. One of the most important aspects to us when designing new products is that we use the highest quality, longest-lasting materials available.

"3 ways to move (mouse) cursor: knob wheels for x and y direction, direction wheel + speed slider and buttons for fast and slow move",1,"Different mouse controls for different uses and for different software. Computer in a moving car may benefit from different physical user interface than tabletop or lap.

In some places, multiple input methods can be in use at once.

Knobs for height and width give precision. Some software, like Blender 3D has 3d cursor that could use knob for depth too, so there is x, y and z axis control. 

For some use, knob could point angle from 0 to 360. Other knob, slider or buttons could control speed of cursor movement to that direction. 

One possibility is to have direction buttons for both fast and slow movement and mid-angles, like this:


https://i.redd.it/njoupu13m1781.png

Double arrow means fast. Center button stops movement.

Fake ""buttons"" and ""knobs"" on touch screens are bad / far from ideal. Buttons, knobs, sliders and joysticks should be steel or wood.",rlzoyb

Solar powered desalinization power station,3,"This would function similarly to how a molting salt solar facility works.

The power generated from the turbine could be used locally or even be used to operate a membrane desalinization process to increase the fresh water output.

Since water boils at a much lower temperature than salt melts the collection area needed would be much smaller so plants would be smaller. 

Now that I'm thinking about it I'm pretty sure molten salt solar plants use steam generated from flashing water on the molten salt to power a steam turbine so literally just having one of these plants on a coast with a continuous supply of salt water.",ru5ziu

And yes there are characters in Disney movies that I think would suit a fighting game that aren't just ""animals being heavies a la Donkey Kong"" (though of the animals I can think of multiple Jungle Book characters that'd work) e.g. Merida and Mulan are obvious roster includes, I've been saying Elsa would suit Smash (and therefore would suit a Smash-alike) since Fighters Pass 2 came out, and even the newest movie Encanto could have some reps despite the heroine's lack of powers as Luisa and Isabela have fighting-game-worthy Gifts (the former would be your typical ""heavy"" fighter (I don't think any Smash-esque game has ever really had a female heavy so that'd be breaking new ground) while the latter would be more of a Zelda-esque character like Elsa would be). And that's just the movies as while it'd be too weird to have someone from the live-action shows there's plenty of potential fighters from the cartoons like Luz from The Owl House (each of her specials etc. could be taken from a different coven's discipline of magic) or Phineas from Phineas And Ferb (who'd be a ""gimmick fighter"" like Villager/Isabelle) or less recent characters like Kim and Shego from Kim Possible or the eponymous American Dragon: Jake Long.

And a ""Disney Smash"" would also lend itself to some really cool stage locations like Ahtohallan or the Beast's castle or some sort of multiple-phase Mulan thing where you're fighting everywhere from the mountains (perhaps with an avalanche hazard) to the rooftops and just imagine the music (sure some of it might be kinda inappropriate for a fighting game even if it's all instrumental but how would fighting to something like Part Of Your World be any less jarring than the more mellow Smash tracks like Brewster's Roost or Swan Lesson). And new fighters coming from new movies or shows would be announced with the thing while new post-launch ones from old properties would be announced like a Smash one would be.

Now the question is, would multiverse shenanigans require Sora to be playable in this too with his Smash moveset (or as close as it'd translate with a potentially different setup) and what would that mean for both multiverses' future connections? ;)",ru526a

The Cartoon National Basketball Association,8,"My name is Walt Disney, and I am the commissioner of the Cartoon National Basketball Association (CNBA) as well as the head coach of Team Mickey. The CNBA is a fantasy basketball league composed of animated characters from popular movies, shows, and video games. 

Here’s a preview of Team Shrek, arguably the best team in the league, led by Shrek, the greatest basketball player in the universe:

Starting Lineup:
Lord Farquad - PG
Three Little Pig - SG
Donkey - SF
Elizabeth the Dragoness - PF
Shrek - C

Reserves:
Big Bad Wolf - PF
Duloc Knight - PG
Gingerbread Man - SG
Puss in Boots - PG

Team Shrek battles against teams such as Team Family Guy, Team SpongeBob, and Team Regular Show, each stacked with players from their respective animated worlds. 

The CNBA is 10,000x more competitive than the NBA. The score of Team Shrek versus the 72-10 Golden State Warriors, for example, would be something like 1,000-0.

Now before y’all come for me, I understand there are essential businesses that have to be open. I know soldiers, officers, doctors etc. can’t just take off for two weeks. I also think two weeks may be too much time, but I’m proposing this because Christmas and New Years week are the time of the year that people want to work the least.

Folks go on vacations, travel and call out in droves. People are forced to return to work when they really don’t want to which causes  poor morale and work ethic. If you give most people at least the week of Christmas off, I guarantee you wouldn’t deal with as much issues with call outs and no shows.

Idea to make a new Kowloon city,16,"So, my plan is to have a person buy about 100 acres of land and then invite anyone and everyone to come and build and live in hopefully leading to a city closely resembling Kowloon walled city before it was demolished in 1993. The total 100 acres would be mostly used for a solar farm to power the city the city itself would only take up around 10 acres comprised of around 1000 buildings if we go of the Kowloon city blueprint. Housing a max population of 500000 people considering that we could build higher than 14 stories the restriction Kowloon had due to its proximity to an airport. The area that I think would be best to build this city is northeast Texas due to its central location and land availability. Water could be collected off of the sloped surfaces of the solar panels allowing for a total collection of 200 Millon gallons per year assuming there are 28 solar panels per acre and each one is 4000ft² and the average rainfall is 34 inches. All the water could be stored underground and on top of buildings as instead of a water tower. With each building likely costing around 10 million that is 10 billion dollars and the solar panels costings 45 million and 1 billion for infrastructure the total comes out to be 11045 million just to build. However, if each person of the assumed half million population pays 22090 dollars, then it will all be paid for all you would have to do is move in.",rogek9

A story set in a world filled with stereotypical fantasy and RPG tropes that explores realistic consequences and reactions involving these tropes.,4,"I first came up with this idea when I was absolutely hammered with my friends and some of their parents. My friends mom and I came up with the general idea, because I hated the fucking hobbit movies so much for what they did to my favorite book of all time. Obviously looking back on it this isn’t even really true, but I said that a goofy “the office” style documentary would have better captured the lighthearted adventure of the book (even now I think it would have been better than what they did with it). But we had a laugh and kinda talked about how it would be funny to see the dwarves sitting there being interviewed and grumbling about the shitty food and goblins and whatever else. 

So since then I’ve always had this little inkling of an idea of a bunch of stories set in a fantasy world, but where it really tries to emphasize how normalized all of the ridiculous fantasy shit is. I’m thinking of things like how some ‘adventurers’ become insanely rich and even affect the politics of major kingdoms and states like in most fantasy settings but then bringing in the perspective of more mediocre adventurers and how it isn’t so glorious and kinda sucks and they struggle to get by dealing with relatively minor problems like the occasional weak magical monster. Maybe something about a group of average soldiers and the issues they have with coming face to face with horrible monsters and legendary warriors that have god-like speed and strength. A merchant who has to deal with magic being an ever present issue and trying to avoid getting scammed by wizards. Stuff like that. 

I don’t know if this has been done before, I’m not really into much contemporary fantasy but I always thought this was a cool idea.",ro4dkq

"The Ocean Side of Earth, Rising Oceans, The Future of Earth & Its Inhabitants",1,"Hey,  So I've had a couple ideas come to me and there's no way they are complete or able to come alive by me alone. So if anything here makes sense to you please share these ideas and get something started;  
1. Free Energy, Basic Necessities, Never ending employment for everyone.  
Check out the ocean side view of earth and think about how humans could use this space to create   
 solar / wind  farms,  & harness kinetic energy from the Ocean waves to create; Free energy for all of humanity, agriculture & building material production, housing & distribution of listed things. To get there we could build floating hexagonal pods that are powered the same way, solar/wind/hydro, to get there and stay while its being built, coming back for materials and stock, but also beginning the production of free necessities via those 3 elements and high efficiency technology, even if we have to remain on fossil fuel to a degree until everything is operational.  

This would change us to a type 1 civilization & turn the Continents of Earth to all first world country status.

 This would also in turn generate basic needs for humans to be born into a world with =/= chances.  No single entity would profit from basic needs anymore, or own this unless it's improved on, or they were the person behind its production and completion. It should be funded and created by all of the nations. Every nation builds a massive pod to set sail / turbo float to the back side where we begin operation: ""Let's make free stuff now that we can, Cause why the hell not.""  


2. Divert rising natural water sources (Lakes, Oceans, etc) with a new highway/tunnel system for aquatic vehicles that are land to water and submersible.   


3. Create trumps massive wall only around the Continents as Kinetic energy harvesters that also serve as wave breakers in the event of a single massive event.. Something far out, or multiple things far out, that will dissipate the strength of a tsunami but not disturb the natural flow of water.    


4. Control the run off water of the Ice caps by creating a water collecting system that collects and brings down fresh water for it to be distributed to 2nd and 3rd world countries until they are 1st world. Or just start bringing down glaciers for them.   


5. Harvest heat energy from volcanos by diverting or tapping into their heat sources without altering the natural surroundings. Kinda just dip some metal toe's in there and let the heat rise and utilize the hot rods.   


6. Take Religion out of everything society has its hand in,  as it is a personal belief and concept some people buy into and some people do not, there's also just too many. Keep Religion at home and in the Churches and what not.  I praise the Sun in a way, but you don't see me throwing it down anyone's throat or writing In Solar Systems We Trust on my cheque's.   


7. Build a newer bigger ISS that is also producing things and drops food / materials / batteries down as it flies over countries / states / provinces  / islands etc

9. Ocean plastics recycling facilities that turn plastics into pellets and 3'd print in the Ocean after being sorted from trash.",rygf40
The Virtual Reef of Intellectual Capital,4,"Cross-pollination has been mentioned in many studies as the way individuals from different backgrounds come together to share inspirations, motivation and support. That is what usually happens in metropolitan areas. Cities like New York, San Francisco, and Tokyo attract creative minds from across the world. They are hubs of innovation that keep pushing the boundaries of what’s possible and that is what [Arkbase](http://arkbase.co/) is all about on the third layer of the internet, the [Web3](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/what-is-web3-new-version-of-the-internet-everyone-is-talking-about-130641883.html?guccounter=1&guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly9kdWNrZHVja2dvLmNvbS8&guce_referrer_sig=AQAAAHYfWFkwLfTyr6pZy88YAS7ftiZg-8qvsQjQKp3gSVAjFf-ArkNnUrhJWcKq3u7Wbcv5082NyilqxdS62AxlXtgRoNsUYHG6kuTriBSERahVwPgv3-p3dgXZyq16gmMXZocsM6uladmYRTUH9k4XKUBATKJKvyrfBFktqQ3sQsFV).

Arkbase can be viewed as a virtual reef where inventors, developers, and investors come together to nurture invention ideas that will change the way things are done. We help abstract ideas get exposure in a crypto-safe environment. What that means is all ideas that are shared on our platform are secured through a Public Ledger Technology (PLT) which saves every transaction in multiple locations and gives a public receipt back in seconds. This allows inventors to bring their supporters in this safe place to discuss the development of their ideas. Once a brainstorming session is concluded, a vote can be taken in a similar decentralized way.

Though voting can usually be considered a complicated process, services like [snapshot.org](https://snapshot.org/) make it easy and transparent. As mentioned in our [previous blog](https://www.arkbase.co/post/token-economics-serving-inventions) about token economics, early investors, along with inventors’ families and friends, are the actual decision-makers through their position of the invention coin. They get to decide where the funds get allocated and what direction should the developing team go. Now the developers, or contributors as we like to call them, are a bit different, they have two ways to join the community and a lesser commitment option. They can either buy tokens in projects they believe in or work their way in.

Developers’ compensation through tokens solves the inventor’s main current problem, being prey to bottom feeders. Getting paid through tokens means that it is in the interest of the developers to do a good job and stick around as long as possible. A CAD designer, for example, can choose to work for an invention and get paid in a token that is worth 0.2 dollars and then stick around and participate in the cross-pollination and voting processes that can bring the value of such a token up to 0.5 or 1 dollar. This process is unique to Arkbase and promises all with a stake in the invention of a democratized environment where every voice is heard and every token held is weighed.

Bringing inventors together with early investors and contributors on one public secure authenticated table could be achieved only after the adaptation of crypto technologies, PLT to be exact and Arkbase is dedicated fully to solving the inventor’s problem. With us, you don’t have to do it alone, we’ll be with you the whole nine yards. We’ll help you launch your coin, raise funds and get developers to work with you using your own token, we only succeed after you do. As [growth engineering](https://www.growthengineering.co.uk/) defines cross-pollination “It's about combining the intellectual capital of individuals with different ways of thinking to reach innovative solutions.” and Arkbase is going to be the virtual reef to do so.",ryawbg

So, imagine a system in any game where you can take clips of your gameplay and submit them to your profile as highlights, but there's also an option to submit the clip as ""suspected suspicious activity"" regarding a specific player. That clip is then posted to a page of that player's profile that isn't publicly available and this would exist alongside a usual ""report player"" system; the point of this is to create a system that only uses bans when absolutely necessary. How so? Instead of just a full ban, your account gets suspended if it has been proven that you cheated(through collected, submitted, and peer-reviewed data over time) and you can only recover it by providing information regarding who you got your cheats from. The cheater then gets their account back, with a 3-strike system put in place where on the 3rd offense, the account is fully banned.


The point of this is data collection to more easily attack the source of the cheats rather than the cheaters themselves. Cheaters can't cheat if the provider can't provide.",rxbicv

App providing Pet transportation services for pet owner to travel with their pets,1,"Some big cities offer solutions to travel with your pet in a taxi or Uber for instance. However, travelling between cities with pets without owning a car is very difficult. The idea is to allow any pet lover who owns a car to promote their next trip online (carpooling app) with the type of pets they are allowing in their vehicle to share the journey. In other words, it is a carpooling app for pet travel. Of course, this will mean that one pet will be considered as an additional passenger and only one family owning pet(s) will be allowed into the vehicle. Travelling from one city to another is very cumbersome with a pet as it usually involves taxi, bus/train and taxi again with pets hopefully being allowed. The current carpooling apps are not pet focused unfortunately and it is not always easy to find a pet friendly owner. Directing the users to the right pet driver for them according to the pet they own, number of people and where they are going is then a key selling point of the app.",rwx2km

Dumb theory on Evolution,1,"
This is an experimental post and it's okay if you think this is dumb ..but I had a lot of fun thinking about it .😂

Idk if it is already somewhere .. someone could have thought about it ..or even discarded it , so no promises there. 

was just studying and chilling watching shows etc .. and this haunting feeling slowly took shape within me .

Just here to blabber as idk what to do with it .

while reading this  You could be intrigued , curious or to say the least .. entertained  Or you could say m high and find plenty of mistakes ... well i don't care ..you can take it anyway you like. Comments and discussion are welcome.

So here it is.

I always wondered evolution agrees survival of fittest.. but never really clicked with what are we doing with so much of cellular organisms and other beings . Well they do survived ofcourse but a what's the purpose kind ..in general .
(No purpose to life ofcourse😂😂)


In All the structure in evolution .. 
We have trancended dimensions .
( I know it's lot more complex than that ..but haven't thought this through)


Organisms evolved from no sense of environment to 3D perception . That's a fact.

Reading all the biolgy we see..

Organnells good at one task came together and made a functioning cell.


Cells evolved from uni cellular to collaborating with other cells with specific diffrentiated functions.

But before this there might be many prokaryotes and unicelluar organism which just evolved in doing and getting better with just what they have.
But once colonizers started to dominate they were in a different league.

Our body is essentially like a planet with really good interconnections between it's cellular residents who all are assingned to do specific functions . Complete with police force , messaging and control systems.
But None can see or feel what we do as a whole.
That is 3D perception.

Let this sink in for a sec. Cauz the cells may not even be aware of the gravity of perception that is available to us.



Maybe ..just maybe 

We are headed there too.

in a sense there exits multiple cellular planets ..like many animals ..
Like the cells..
It's the same for humans .. and a few others like the Termites , which are so good at colonization that there colonies are actually considered to be SUPERORGANISM ..the basis of this discussion.

For what we know maybe the plant population attempt it in forrests .
Anyways the humans could be doing this by means of technology.

For eg . We don't see the light in its full spectrum.
But we know about it and have utilised it to our advantage.
Through extensions of technology.

By internet and other means ..we are making an interconnected society, or at least headed there.

It could get so good to a point that we eventually function like an ORGANISM.

with existence and perception in literally more dimensions than we could imagine.

From 2D cells to 3D organisms ..what next ..

Or we are just cancer to this already existing organism.😅😅

And this is just one organism .. say an Earth (like a human)
Or any other organisms ( elephant ..dog.. or even . Sun .. mars..etc etc 😂)

It would be cool i knw , and yes it could actually also go in completly different direction and we could be near extinction ofcourse, outdone by our own creation...or even singulairty and stuff .😂

But 
Who cares.😊✌️

I enjoyed this.. may be was fun for u too 😅
Peace .",rwgw4r
